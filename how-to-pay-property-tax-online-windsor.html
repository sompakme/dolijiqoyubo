That magical time of year where the joy of homeownership collides with the cold, hard reality of filling the government's coffers. But fear not, fellow Windsorites! There's a way to avoid the long lines, the awkward encounters with old neighbours, and the whole "hunting down a stamp" fiasco. I present to you, the glorious option of <strong>paying your property tax online</strong>.</p><h3 data-sourcepos=5:1-5:39>Why Online? You Got Options, Buddy!</h3><p data-sourcepos=7:1-7:284>Let's face it, venturing out into the real world just to pay taxes feels a bit like participating in an outdated medieval ritual. Online payments are the knight in shining armor (or should we say, shining cursor?) that swoops in to save the day. Here's why it's the ultimate champion:</p><ul data-sourcepos=9:1-12:0><li data-sourcepos=9:1-9:228><strong>Convenience is King (or Queen):</strong> You can literally do this in your pajamas while munching on leftover pizza. No need to change out of those comfy sweats (because let's be honest, that's what most of us are rocking at home).</li><li data-sourcepos=10:1-10:302><strong>Speed Demon:</strong> Forget waiting in line behind someone who forgot their glasses and needs to decipher every detail on the payment form. Online payments are lightning fast, meaning you can get back to the important things, like scrolling through cat videos or finally conquering that crossword puzzle.</li><li data-sourcepos=11:1-12:0><strong>The Paperless Hero:</strong> Mother Earth will be doing a happy dance because you're saving a tree (and let's be real, probably a squirrel or two who might have become collateral damage in the paper chase).</li></ul><h3 data-sourcepos=13:1-13:70>Alright, Alright, You Convinced Me. But How Do I Do This Sorcery?</h3><p data-sourcepos=15:1-15:120>Now that you're pumped about the magic of online payments, here's a breakdown of the steps, minus the smoke and mirrors:</p><p data-sourcepos=17:1-17:34><strong>For the Windsor, Ontario crew:</strong></p><ul data-sourcepos=19:1-24:0><li data-sourcepos=19:1-19:194>Head over to the City of Windsor's <strong>mystical</strong> (okay, maybe not mystical) <strong>MyWindsor</strong> online service ([link city of windsor online property tax ON City of Windsor (.ca) citywindsor.ca]).</li><li data-sourcepos=20:1-20:149>You might need to create an account if you're a first-timer. Don't worry, it's easier than putting together those fancy flatpack furniture pieces.</li><li data-sourcepos=21:1-21:115>Once you're logged in, find the <strong>Online Payments App</strong> (because apparently, paying taxes is an app these days).</li><li data-sourcepos=22:1-22:206>Here's the key part: You'll need your <strong>roll number</strong>, which is your very own property tax code. Find it on your tax bill (the one that probably arrived strategically hidden under a pile of junk mail).</li><li data-sourcepos=23:1-24:0>Once you've entered your roll number, follow the on-screen prompts and choose your payment method (credit card, bank account, carrier pigeon... okay, maybe not the last one).</li></ul><p data-sourcepos=25:1-25:44><strong>For our friends in Windsor, Connecticut:</strong></p><ul data-sourcepos=27:1-31:0><li data-sourcepos=27:1-27:173>The Town of Windsor has got your back too! You can access their online tax payment system ([link windsor ct online property tax ON Town of Windsor townofwindsorct.com]).</li><li data-sourcepos=28:1-28:107>They offer two options: <strong>Tax Inquiry</strong> to view your bill and <strong>Make a Payment</strong>. Choose your adventure!</li><li data-sourcepos=29:1-29:104>You'll need some handy dandy information like your <strong>property number</strong> or <strong>name</strong> to find your bill.</li><li data-sourcepos=30:1-31:0>Similar to our Ontario counterparts, you can then choose to pay with a <strong>checking account</strong> or a <strong>credit card</strong> (convenience fees may apply, so be sure to check).</li></ul><h3 data-sourcepos=32:1-32:54>Tax Payment Champions: A Few Pointers to Remember</h3><ul data-sourcepos=34:1-37:0><li data-sourcepos=34:1-34:252><strong>Don't Be a Last-Minute Larry (or Lucy):</strong> While online payments are fantastic, remember there might be processing times. Don't wait until the day before the due date to avoid any late payment penalties (those things sting worse than a paper cut).</li><li data-sourcepos=35:1-35:245><strong>Double Check Your Digits:</strong> Nobody wants to accidentally pay someone else's property tax (unless it's your arch nemesis, then maybe that's a story for another day). Make sure those roll numbers and bank account numbers are entered correctly.</li><li data-sourcepos=36:1-37:0><strong>Keep Your Receipts:</strong> Just like your grandma always said, "save your receipts!" This is your proof of payment in case of any future inquiries.</li></ul><p data-sourcepos=38:1-38:304>There you have it, folks! Conquering property tax payments online is a breeze. Now go forth and celebrate your newfound freedom from long lines and paper trails. Just remember, with great convenience comes great responsibility...to use that extra time wisely (responsible napping is totally acceptable).</p>2022-11-15T19:11:02.074+05:30<p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvWrGWtnZOdfHN8kW1maWxfnby4edOoZKmZqWK9s7vPnqmtsV2prrl5zqejoqaVYsSqusOspqtmmKm6rQ%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestD - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
