And as one gets older, then things start to get more challenging. I haven’t fallen asleep or started dribbling yet on the show, so I thought it’s best to go before I start to do so!” he said at the time.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Goodman also faced a number of health problems in his life. He underwent surgery for </span><span style=font-weight:400>prostate cancer</span><span style=font-weight:400> in 2009 and for </span><span style=font-weight:400>facial melanoma</span><span style=font-weight:400> in 2020.
