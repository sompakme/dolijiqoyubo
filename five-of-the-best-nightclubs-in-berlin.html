Photo / Getty Images</p><p><strong>Party it up at one of these hot spots in the German capital</strong></p><h2 class=article__heading>Berghain and Panorama Bar</h2><p>Notoriously difficult to get into, <a href=#>Berghain</a> is the stuff of legends. Housed in a historic power station in the former east, the club boasts some of the biggest names in techno and plenty of freaky goings on. If you attempt a visit, it's most likely you'll wait for hours just to be turned away — but if you make it inside, you'll definitely have some stories to tell.</p><p>If you're really serious about it, prepare yourself for the questions posed by the tattooed and pierced bouncer Sven Marquardt by visiting <a href=#>Berhaintrainer.com</a> — it's an incredibly realistic simulation of what it's like to arrive at the door.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.nzherald.co.nz/resizer/J4yKWKfgIivegDYQADtl_UhTmpw=/16x11/smart/filters:quality(70)/cloudfront-ap-southeast-2.images.arcpublishing.com/nzme/D5QL7C7AQWMFRZXSBQCUBS7IVA.jpg"><h2 class=article__heading>KitKatClub</h2><p>You might need to strip down to get into <a href=#>this one</a>. Opened by a pornographic film maker in 1994, it's no surprise some fairly eye-opening exploits go on inside. Back in its heyday, punters were openly encourage to get down and dirty on the dance floor and conservative politicians in the city tried to get it shut down.</p><span class=ad__heading data-test-ui=ad__heading data-ad-env=both>Advertisement</span><a class=ad__link data-test-ui=ad__link href=# data-ad-env=both>Advertise with NZME.</a><p>It might have quietened down a bit since then and some people really do visit just for the music. However, a strict dress code remains — if you want to get in, the freakier, the better.</p><h2 class=article__heading>Tresor</h2><p>This <a href=#>techno club</a> has a long history, dating back to before the fall of the Berlin Wall. While it's moved over the years, Tresor is now located in a huge former power plant in central Berlin. Inside, there are several dancefloors, a large outdoor area and of course, never-ending music. If you can't get into Berghain, this is an easier and friendlier option.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.nzherald.co.nz/resizer/PCOSapKgXECm4CqcRTF2eWSvTRA=/16x11/smart/filters:quality(70)/cloudfront-ap-southeast-2.images.arcpublishing.com/nzme/SRGIVVAPDGRV3EP3UPBZLWHXHE.jpg"><h2 class=article__heading>Sisyphos</h2><p>Almost as infamous as Berghain, <a href=#>Sisyphos</a> is like no other club. There's a huge chill out zone, an abandoned bus, a small lake, a pizza place and a huge maze of dance floors to experience. It's located in the far-flung suburb of Rummelsburg, but you can get there easily on a shuttle from Ostkreuz. However, after a long stretch in the club, you might want to put aside some cash for a cab ride home at the end of it all.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.nzherald.co.nz/resizer/RSHorYc9K8awCWNmnyhvt9JO_Ro=/16x12/smart/filters:quality(70)/cloudfront-ap-southeast-2.images.arcpublishing.com/nzme/IIT2K2SAIICQ65JTECXOAFODCI.jpg"><h2 class=article__heading>Kater Blau</h2><p>"The Blue Tomcat" was originally known as Bar 25, before attracting international attention for its quality house DJs. It later changed its name to Kater Holzig, before reopening in 2014 <a href=#>under its current name</a>. Located on the banks of the Spree River, it's a great place to party in summer, with its large outdoor area including the deck of a boat. It's hard to get in here, but if you really care about the music you'll feel right at home inside.</p><span class=ad__heading data-test-ui=ad__heading data-ad-env=both>Advertisement</span><a class=ad__link data-test-ui=ad__link href=# data-ad-env=both>Advertise with NZME.</a><h2 class="related-articles__heading section-travel">Related articles</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r8bHnqmapJRjsLB6zbNmraqRq7Kte8WirZ5ln5t6tbTEZpmeq6Riu6qzx62apa2SqHqquoybnKukmaN8joOxiW59end7noybqnt7ho6AjZ%2BIlqGLjYJn</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestD - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
