And it's easy to see why they pay the extravagant membership fee to attend; amenities include both personal training and bespoke packages, designed to help clients to achieve their goals. There are also a number of group classes on offer including yoga, Pilates, spinning and kickboxing, as well as prenatal classes, which would be ideal for Pippa, who is pregnant with her first child.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/8ea9f5b21f40-prince-harry-invictus-z.jpg><p style=text-align:center id=e4n8fTv0-5-q data-wc=10><strong>Prince Harry is a member of KX Gym in Chelsea</strong></p><p id=ehx0nIrEu9YD data-wc=66>Harry's gym also offers a number of other facilities, including a swimming pool, sauna and steam room, spa and plunge pool.

"Meghan has completely changed Harry's diet," a source told Daily Mail. "She's got him juicing and he has lost at least half a stone, which is a lot for someone as skinny as he is. They have bought a top-of-the-range juicer and she has him on fruit and veg smoothies. She's also weaning him off meat."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/48b5671abb73-meghan-markle-prince-harry-anzac-day-service-z.jpg><p style=text-align:center id=eA0BQ7NWrTSL data-wc=15><strong>Harry is reportedly on a health kick before the royal wedding inspired by Meghan Markle</strong></p><p id=ebmUlnYVvq_g data-wc=49>Former actress Meghan, meanwhile, has always followed a strict diet and exercise regime.
