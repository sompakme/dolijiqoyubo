Carrie looked gorgeous in a see-through bodysuit that boasted gems and intricate gold decorations strategically placed to protect her modesty.&nbsp;</p><p id=eOV5guAyV8h data-wc=37>The flesh-colored one-piece also featured exaggerated epaulets on either shoulder that had delicate gold fringing that fell to Carrie's waist. And as if the top half of her outfit wasn't enough, Carrie's skirt was truly a spectacle.&nbsp;</p><p id=en32XnVVV9 data-wc=37>The floor-length creation boasted a full skirt with feather-style peplum and a floor-sweeping train. It also had a thigh-high slit that showcased Carrie's sculpted legs, which were elongated even further in a pair of platform gold heels.&nbsp;</p><p id=ebrBhR3iYo data-wc=42>Carrie's hair was styled in glamorous, voluminous curls and she accessorized with long, drop earrings and some ornate rings. As for her makeup, she stuck to the color scheme and rocked gold eyelids with a flush of bronzer and a nude lip.&nbsp;</p><p id=e7TvXv9JKk data-wc=72>Needless to say, her followers were blown away when she shared the cover on Instagram, with one responding: "Absolutely gorgeous. Carrie you Rock and Roll when you choose to, but you are definitely Country Strong." A second said: "Perfection at its finest love you Carrie." A third added: "Leg goals!" A fourth gushed: "So gorgeous and beautiful and lovely and so flaming hot as always and I [love] them gorgeous sparkling eyes."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/dd095793ff86-gettyimages-1479193920.jpg><p id=eVSnginnHm data-wc=69>In the accompanying interview, Carrie – who will return to her Las Vegas residency on June 21 – opened up about her life on the Strip and selling out shows while balancing being a wife and mom. Carrie has been married to former hockey player Mike Fisher since 2010, and they share two sons, Isaiah, eight, and Jacob, four, and the country star is all about the mom life.</p><p id=eGIYCALBOB data-wc=61><strong>"I love my role as a mom and wife,"</strong> she told the outlet.<strong> "In addition to what I get to do on stage, I go to baseball practice. It's wonderfully ordinary, and I love that. In a lot of ways, I lead a double life. I'm mom at home, and then I fly away to Vegas or to go on tour."</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/7a338d03d1e9-carrie-underwood-sons-las-vegas-residency.jpg><p id=e1PxrW9-zH data-wc=42>She gushed about the exciting things she had in store for her time in Vegas, although revealed that the glitz fans see on stage won't be extending off it as much given her husband and sons largely remain at home in Nashville.&nbsp;</p><p id=e3K8w6Ol6O data-wc=36><strong>"I don't leave Resorts World too often,"</strong> she confessed. "That's one of the great things about Vegas in general – you can go and stay at your preferred place, and everything you need is right there."&nbsp;</p><p id=eF51Z1D_en data-wc=71>Mike and her sons will occasionally pay a visit to support Carrie, though. "I might pop into a restaurant if my husband's in town, but I kind of keep to myself. For the most part, I just go to the grocery store because I enjoy having my own food around me. If I eat room service all the time, I'm not going to be able to fit into my tour clothes!"</p><p id=egafOcznia data-wc=9><strong>See more photos of Carrie and her family below...</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/07d6b8062e8b-carrie-underwood-mike-fisher-cmt-awards.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/1385d03108d5-carrie-underwood-mike-fisher-cma-awards.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/207fa10133ab-carriestage.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/7691120bac15-carrie-underwood-sons-isaiah-jacob.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/3a5ff8f68aee-gettyimages-1391117126.jpg><p id=exHSpnNTgf data-wc=6>Read more <a class=hm-link href=#>HELLO!
