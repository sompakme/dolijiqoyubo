The duo’s chemistry was so intense during the filming and press run of A Star Is Born that (if you’ll remember) they were the subject of countless “are they or aren’t they” rumors around their relationship status, something Gaga addressed on Jimmy Kimmel Live in 2019: “First of all, social media, quite frankly, is the toilet of the internet,” she said. “And what it has done to pop culture is abysmal. Yes, people saw love, and guess what? That’s what we wanted you to see. This is a love song. The movie A Star Is Born is a love story. It was so important to both of us that we were connected the entire time…Look, I’ve had my arms wrapped around Tony Bennett for three years touring the world. When you’re singing love songs, that’s what you want people to feel. I’m an artist and I guess we did a good job—fooled ya!” (Gaga is specifically referencing their performance of “Shallow”—from the movie’s soundtrack—at <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-auto-tag-linker=true data-before-rewrite-localise=https://www.marieclaire.com/tag/oscars/>the Oscars</a>.)</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/gEcRshbKkFbuR9XUgWCHd9-1920-80.jpg><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/vKxD34zEMajpyzt58BjCv7-1920-80.jpg><p>For his part, Cooper told<a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-url=https://people.com/movies/bradley-cooper-made-friend-for-life-lady-gaga-star-is-born/ referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-hl-processed=none> <u>People</u></a> in 2018 “I made a friend for life. As great as this movie was, the thing that I think I’ll take away forever is the relationship I have with her [Gaga] because she is an incredible person. I’m very lucky to have worked with her.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/DhN972CQ7rAsfRGDxhGgCC-1920-80.jpg><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/wySyAC3KgvZ95BM32FhkM4-1920-80.jpg><p>In addition to Gaga’s surprise appearance, there was another girl on Cooper’s arm that we were so happy to see: his six-year-old daughter Lea, who he shares with ex Irina Shayk.

That’s not spinning it, that’s just the truth.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/RyHAHSHGs4vBTRHSvENUw8-1920-80.jpg><p>Maestro is about legendary composer Leonard Bernstein and will hit Netflix a week from today, on December 20.
