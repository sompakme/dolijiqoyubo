She has made that abundantly clear. A recent tweet of hers confirmed jumping out of planes and testing the limits of height are not on her bucket list. And while scuba diving and Mt. Everest might not see <a href=# rel>Ms. Lennox</a> anytime soon, there's another group that won't be spending quality time with the R&B artist. At the very end of <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">her Twitter list</a>, she calls out "music industry people" and her being okay with not dating anyone from the music scene.</p><p>The artist has had numerous relationships that turned sour due to the simple truth that they were also in the music business. Ari Lennox is famous and has many top-tier hits, including "Pressure" and <a href=# rel>"Shea Butter Baby</a>." When you're as well-known as Lennox is, people date you to get clout or to network in the industry as a struggling rapper. Lennox feels jaded from the whole experience. There have apparently been numerous ex-partners who either pretended not to know who she was or didn't let on that they were trying to make it big in music until later.

She's even had partners that demeaned her and didn't even recognize her musical achievements. Safe to say, Ari Lennox is done with the belittling and the lying. Hopefully, she can find someone who wants to date her for her, not just what she does for a living. For now, that means not dating anyone in music, period.</p><p>What's next for Ms. Lennox? She's currently on tour after dropping both <a href=# rel>Age/Sex/Location</a>, her second studio album, and her surprise EP <a href=# rel>Away Message</a> last year. (According to her, <a href=# rel>this is her last tour</a>.) She is signed to J Cole's Dreamville Records. Lennox has singles like "Whipped Cream," which is about a previous relationship that went bad. We pray that Ari makes new music about her aversion to music industry dating. She has plenty of material for another album. (As of this writing, Ari Lennox is not dating anyone. However, this could be her keeping her personal business out of the limelight. At this point, we wouldn't put it past her.)</p><p><strong>Read more: <a href=# rel>J Cole Shocks Ari Lennox at London Concert</a></strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvTp5ywoJmltbC8jZympmdmbYV6gY9mmKuhXaGyr7rOsWSwp56peqWt055koqaUqsC1vthmp56noKGy</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestD - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
