Discussion has been circulating and he addressed Melyssa Ford's recent apology regarding implications of illicit activities. The rap veteran took to the podcast on Tuesday (Dec. 5), <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">using his platform </a>to fire back at Ford after she raised questions about his involvement with an underage prostitute. The entire saga began when Ford objected to Cam'ron and Ma$e recounting a story about their encounters with a prostitute on a recent episode of their show. On her cohosting gig on the <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Joe Budden</a> Podcast, Ford raised concerns about the possibility of underage individuals being involved in the <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">controversial narrative.</a></p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Cam'ron saw this however, and wasn't fond of what Ford was saying. He responded with his own take. "Be careful," Killa Cam warned on his podcast. "I tell you one thing, I know a lot of people in ICE. Snipers, sharpshooters, and I know people in ICE. I'll have you escorted back across the border. Be careful. It screams desperation, but we'll get a petition to get you out of the country. Cut it out. I'll get her out of the country. I'll make two calls, man." Then, Ford apologized and said she didn't mean to make that insinuation. On the latest episode of the <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">Joe Budden Podcast,</a> Ford made her apology public. "I apologize, I should never have made that insinuation," she said.</p><span><h2 class="__className_a6f35b font-bold text-2xl lg:text-[2.125rem] mb-[18px] font-poppins leading-10" id=h-cam-ron-doubles-down>Cam'Ron Doubles Down</h2></span><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Taking the feud to social media, Cam'ron intensified the disrespect on Instagram the following day (Dec. 6). Sharing a photo of himself with Melyssa Ford, seemingly taken at a red carpet event, he captioned the post with, "I told the b***h 'don’t touch me' when we took this pic. F**k you and ya apology!! Stay strong and stand on business!! We just busy at the moment, we’ll get to you soon boo and nothing violent!! Before you accuse us of more shit that’s inaccurate." The hip-hop heavyweight remains unrelenting in his response.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Moreover, this sets the stage for a tense and publicized clash between two prominent figures in the industry. However, social media actually sided with Ford on a few points that she made. "All she said was could there be a possibility there could’ve been underage girls there and it is a possibility," one person commented. "She did not accuse them of anything," another defended. "Let's not act like there aren't underage girls in those places and she posed a real question. These dudes are ready for adult conversation. Leave her alone; she apologized. Cam has no morale high ground to stand on." "She's a og vixen in the game & has seen enough stuff to write a book if she wanted to..." another said. What are your thoughts on this situation?
