Now, the person responsible for her perfectly polished nails, <a class=hm-link href=# rel=nofollow>Marina Sandoval</a>, has teamed up with <a class=hm-link href=# rel=nofollow>Hatton Jewellers</a> to share their top tips for your engagement and wedding manicure – and what not to do.</p><h2 dir=ltr>What manicure did Princess Kate have on her wedding day?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/4857ee416be2-kate-wedding-nails.jpg><p id=eri9n4J6ZhH data-wc=35>Similar to her engagement photos, which saw the Princess with natural clear nails and a blue Issa dress that complimented her ring, Kate chose a <a class=hm-link href=#>subtle pink manicure</a> on her wedding day in April 2011.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/1621a7b6270e-duchess-kate-wedding-dress-veil.jpg><p id=ezFbK6_4y0X data-wc=31>It was made from a unique combination of Bourjois' '28 Rose Lounge,' a nude shade that is opaque after one coat, and Essie's '423 Allure', which further enhanced the natural finish.&nbsp;</p><p id=eeye9MJ7yk data-wc=31>The latter was one of the late Queen Elizabeth's go-to brands, and although Kate's bridal colour has been discontinued, it has a revamped '<a class=hm-link href=# rel=nofollow>Allure</a>' which Essie promises is "fit for royalty."</p><figure class=videoPlayerClass_v1tejlff>WATCH: All the best moments from William and Kate's royal wedding</figure><p id=eHvEkAED719 data-wc=63>"Catherine wanted something very natural looking and I felt these matched her skin colour beautifully. She wanted something off-white and bridal, so these were absolutely perfect," Marina told the <a class=hm-link href=# rel=nofollow>Daily Mail</a>. "She was very pleased with the result and told me that it looked beautiful and elegant. I can’t wait to see the result when Prince William places his ring on her finger."</p><p id=eesjCpWULRX data-wc=12><strong>LOOK:&nbsp;</strong><a class=hm-link href=#>12 royal brides' wedding beauty secrets you'll wish you knew sooner</a></p><p id=eTNueIiOQZ data-wc=13><strong>READ: <a class=hm-link href=#>Bridal beauty treatments: Everything Meghan Markle, Kate Middleton and more had done</a></strong></p><h2 dir=ltr>What colour should your nails be for your wedding?</h2><p id=ei00BwVrFiP data-wc=62>Interestingly, Kate's chosen hue continues to be very popular among brides today as nude colours tie in with every colour scheme and never go out of fashion. "Around 50 per cent of my clients will go for a pale pink natural nail colour and the other 50 per cent will go for a warmer shade like peach or light pink," Marina said.</p><p id=eM0tnjHk6lG data-wc=23>However, she noted that different shades complement and clash with different skin tones, so it's important to choose the right colour for you:&nbsp;</p><ul><li dir=ltr>Fair skin: blush pinks&nbsp;</li><li dir=ltr>Medium skin: pinky/beige nude&nbsp;</li><li dir=ltr>Olive skin: creamy nude or peachy shades&nbsp;</li><li dir=ltr>Dark skin: dusty rose or coffee-coloured tones&nbsp;</li></ul><p id=eRwKijXqwBcR data-wc=49>Another timeless choice is the French manicure, which features a pink or nude base with delicate white tips that mimic your real nail. Marina recommends not going too overboard with any nail art or glitter as they "make the hand look artificial and take away from the precious stone."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/55a5ebbc174c-bride-groom-holding-hands-wedding-ring.jpg><p id=ei6DX6tTJSTj data-wc=56>If you're choosing a bolder colour, make sure it's one that ties in with your colour scheme or your engagement ring stone. The celebrity makeup artist explained: "Emerald stones can be paired with red or dark green nail polish, whereas rubies will blend well with a burgundy red and also contrast nicely with an off-white shade."</p><p id=exspSTBudh1T data-wc=30>The overall lesson? Although it's perhaps one of the most overlooked parts of a bride's beauty look, your nails should be picture-perfect for the close-up photos of your wedding ring.</p><h2 dir=ltr>What manicure should I choose for my engagement photos?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/0db3be19b512-kate-engagement-nails.jpg><p id=e23GSzZh55NQ data-wc=40>Your nails may be on your mind long before you actually walk down the aisle. In fact, the research found that there has been a 122 per cent increase in online searches for "engagement ring nails" over the past year.&nbsp;</p><p id=ekzAZQJQqzEl data-wc=46>While you can choose any colour you'd like, there is a clever tip to make your engagement ring pop – by matching your nail shape. Hatton Jewellers and Marina suggested the following nail shapes based on your engagement ring if you want that perfect engagement photo:</p><h3 dir=ltr>Princess and cushion-cut engagement rings</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/0c6887603490-bride-groom-exchanging-wedding-rings.jpg><p id=e-gIf_u-AeLT data-wc=35>If you've got a popular princess-cut diamond, known for its symmetrical and square shape, or a cushion-cut diamond, which features rounded corners, Marina explained: "Squared-off nails help reiterate the sharper fancier feeling of diamond shapes.”</p><h3 dir=ltr>Round and oval engagement rings&nbsp;</h3><p id=eXJbtTlR0pp7 data-wc=23>An obvious choice for round and oval cut diamonds are rounded nails, which Marina said will "embrace the symmetry of your round stone."</p><h3 dir=ltr>Marquise and pear-shaped engagement rings</h3><p id=ezQZo--LaeNU data-wc=42>A marquise-cut diamond is a low-cut diamond with 58 facets while a pear-shaped diamond has a rounded bottom tapering to a point at the top. "Playing off the points of a stiletto or almond-shaped nails will compliment these diamond cuts," she said.</p><h3 dir=ltr>Emerald-cut engagement rings&nbsp;</h3><p id=eZgAw3M9OLcJ data-wc=24>A squoval nail shape perfectly mimics an emerald-cut diamond, which has a shallow pavilion and open table to accentuate the clarity of the stone.</p><p id=e9O_GJZ50qs data-wc=14><strong>READ MORE:&nbsp;</strong><a class=hm-link href=#>Queen Letizia teamed £6m wedding dress with unexpected heirlooms from royal in-laws</a></p><p id=eUc-ep-mDaS data-wc=26><strong>Planning your wedding?
