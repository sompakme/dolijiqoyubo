During her appearance on the <strong>Jason Lee Show</strong> on <strong>Revolt</strong>, Chyna explained that she was "changing everything about me" and that "all that stuff is a dead end, and I know that I'm worth way more than that."</p><p><strong>Chyna</strong>, who shares two children with <strong>Tyga and Rob Kardashian</strong>, revealed that she wanted to set an example for her children and that she had bigger fish to fry. She also cited the numerous legal woes she has had recently as contributing to her decision to leave the platform.</p><p>Despite leaving <strong>OnlyFans</strong>, Chyna was quick to show support for those who were still earning a living on the platform: "Shout out to the people that do still have their <strong>OnlyFans</strong> and stuff like that" and advised them to "get your money" but not let the money control them.</p><p></p><h2 class=ue-c-article__subheadline>She felt vindicated after her lawsuit against Kardashians</h2><p>Chyna also spoke about her <a href=#>$100 million defamation lawsuit against the Kardashians</a>, saying, "Thank God that I did sued the Kardashians... regardless of the outcome. I stood up for myself because there were layers to it." Chyna ultimately lost the lawsuit, but she said she felt "vindicated" after taking the famous family to court.</p><p>When asked if she wanted an apology from <strong>Kris Jenner</strong>, Chyna said: "Honestly, I don't care about nobody's apologies. <strong>Unless it comes with a Ferrari</strong>. Then, I'll take it."</p><p>Chyna has been keeping busy with other projects, including earning a feature acting role on BET's <strong>The Black Hamptons</strong> and in <strong>Amazon Prime</strong> film <strong>Secret Society 2</strong>.</p><p>Chyna's decision to leave OnlyFans highlights the changing landscape of the platform, which has been facing increased scrutiny over the content that is posted on it. As more high-profile users leave the platform, it remains to be seen how OnlyFans will evolve -or survived- in the coming years.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rq3RnJhnm5%2BifKa6jqWgn52jqcatsY6cnKWdkqe2tbXErGZraGJofHF%2FjmpoaG5kZa%2BksMFraW9wlWiyea2UbG%2BbbGZnhm%2B006aj</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestD - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
