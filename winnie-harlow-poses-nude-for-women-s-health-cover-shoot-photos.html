In April, the Canadian starlet continues to expand her <a href=# rel>undeniably impressive modelling resume</a>, this time stripping down for the cover of Women's Health. For the magazine's May issue, she not only posed nude for the cover and various other photos, but Harlow also got candid about the rejection she's faced within the industry as a result of her skin condition. Because of her unique look, the socialite has made it something of a personal mission for herself to "change the definition of beauty."</p><p>"I got a lot of no's along the way, but I just pushed through," the 28-year-old told the outlet while reflecting on how vitiligo has impacted her career. "My younger self always believed in the power of faith, strength, and perseverance, while learning vulnerability and being authentically myself," Harlow added. "To achieve my goals with the world watching has been scary at times, but all in all, the ultimate blessing." As DailyMail notes, she first caught the public's eye in 2014 while competing on the 21st cycle of America's Next Top Model.</p><span><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-winnie-harlow-bares-it-all-for-women-s-health>Winnie Harlow Bares It All for Women's Health</h2></span><p>Harlow's cover is a simple one, keeping the focus mostly on her long, flowing hair, beautiful face, and the patches of different colours all over her toned body. She celebrated the special moment on Instagram today (April 25), sharing photos and videos from the magazine itself, as well as exclusive behind-the-scenes content from her photo shoot. "Back in my childhood when I would wish upon a star to not look the way I did because of the ridicule I received, I wouldâ€™ve never dreamt of not only being so confident in who I am but also encouraging others to do the same," Winnie reflected in her post.</p><p>Elsewhere in her chat with the magazine, she spoke about crafting her moniker (her real name is Chantelle Whitney Brown-Young), as well as her ability to inspire others with the confidence she's grown into.
