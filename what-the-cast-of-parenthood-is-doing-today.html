From girls' nights with Crosby's sisters to heart-to-hearts with other family members, Jasmine became part of the family. Not to mention the importance of her interracial relationship with Crosby, raising a bi-racial child, and the way their story was beautifully weaved together, as she discussed with <a href=#>Essence</a> at the time.</p><p>Since the show ended, Joy has stayed close to her love for the small screen,&nbsp;taking on roles in programs like "Trinkets, "For Life," and "Cherish the Day." As of this writing, she's set to star as Helen Grace in 2024's "The Spiderwick Chronicles" series on Disney+. In addition to acting, Joy has also been involved in music and modeling. She and her husband, David Bryant, founded the <a href=#>Basic Terrain</a> clothing line, with the products "inspired by their love of travel, adventure, and laid back living."</p><p>In 2022, Joy shared her passion for self-care and wellness in an interview with <a href=#>New Beauty</a>, noting&nbsp;that she focuses on eating well, staying hydrated, exercising, and meditation, as well as a solid skin care routine to keep herself looking and feeling her best. "Get good sleep on the regular; eat the best food you can afford; exercise every day, even if it's just a simple walk; sit in the sun and soak up some rays; give love to yourself and to others," Joy told the outlet. "I've adopted that as my wellness recipe, sprinkled with a healthy dose of gratitude."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmamxkZ4N5fo6cmKysXaSzbrzAq5ynrJikvKV506ibmrFf</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestD - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
