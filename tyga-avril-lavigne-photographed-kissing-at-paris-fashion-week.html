While neither party has confirmed a fling in, say, an Instagram post, the smooch certainly makes things hard to dent. Moreover, the assumed couple posted plenty of stylish fits on their socials in celebration of the fashion event. Still, as soon as pictures spread across social media, fans had a field day. Hopefully the two can make a proper assessment on their status without focusing on media breathing down their necks.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Furthermore, rumors started flying after the pop-punk singer's split from Mod Sun. "Avril and Mod Sun have been on and off for the past two months, but are <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">no longer together as a couple,</a>” an insider said. “Avril and Tyga are genuinely friends and nothing more," added a source to PEOPLE. "There was absolutely no third party involved in the split.” Meanwhile, one of Mod Sun's reps expressed surprise at the news. "They were together and engaged as of three days ago when Mod left for tour so if anything has changed that’s news to him," they expressed. "Mod will be performing tonight in Portland at The Hawthorne Theater."</p><span><h2 class="__className_a6f35b font-bold text-2xl lg:text-[2.125rem] mb-[18px] font-poppins leading-10" id=h-tyge-avril-lavigne-spotted-kissing>Tyge & Avril Lavigne Spotted Kissing</h2></span><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Not only that, but the first time the two artists in question sparked gossip was <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">a NOBU date.</a> After they left in the same vehicle, many caught the hint that something deeper was going on. Amid their outings in Paris, Mod actually took to Instagram to share his feelings. "In 1 week my entire life completely changed…I just know there’s a plan for it all,” he wrote. “I’ll keep my head up + always listen to my heart, even when it feels broken [broken heart emoji]. Being surrounded by love every night on tour has been an absolute blessing. I have the best friends in the entire world, thanks for always having my back. See you on stage."</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Of course, many fans expressed shock at the pairing, but that's the way love goes sometimes. It's unclear whether <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">all this speculatio</a>n is due to an actual relationship between the two. Still, time will tell if things are official, and Twitter will continue to light a fire over it. Regardless, stick around on HNHH for the latest updates on Tyga and Avril Lavigne.</p><p>About The Author</p><p>Gabriel Bras Nevares is a music and pop culture news writer for HotNewHipHop.
