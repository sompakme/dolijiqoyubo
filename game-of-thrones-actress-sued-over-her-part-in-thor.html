Her old agency claims she owes them huge money in commission fees and hence the lawsuit. The agency says Lena Headey owes them more than $500,000 for her part in Thor: Love and Thunder. Lena Headey did act in the movie, but her scenes were cut.</p><p>The agency also demands Lena Headey to pay $300,000 in commission fees for her role in the movie 9 Bullets and $650,000 for her part in the Television series Rita, the show that did not go beyond the first episode.</p><p>Lena Headey’s former agency Troika claims the actress owes them hundreds of thousands of dollars in fees since she started earning through the roles she did in movies and on television. Lena Headey joined Troika in 2005 and she left in 2020.</p><p>Now the agency wants her to pay the commission fees she allegedly owes them and they issued the legal order also wanting the actress to pay the damages due to her breach of contract.</p><p>Lena says she never signed a contract with the agency and everyone worked on the basis of an oral agreement. The GoT actress also says that the director of Thor: Love and Thunder directly approached her and Troika has nothing to do with her earnings on the film.</p><p class=post-tag>Tags <a href=# rel=tag>Cersei Lannister</a> <a href=# rel=tag>Game Of Thrones Cersei Lannister</a> <a href=# rel=tag>Lena Headey</a> <a href=# rel=tag>Lena Headey Thor</a> <a href=# rel=tag>Thor Love and Thunder</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qMHLrZxnm5%2BifLW%2BxKebrGdhbYB1gZdonpqllWK8p3nToamoppWoeqKv06ucrKtdqMKmsIyorZ6qXZ2ys3nPmqmtZZmjerW0zqs%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestD - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
