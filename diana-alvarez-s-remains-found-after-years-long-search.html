Her cause of death has not yet been determined, a sheriff’s office spokesperson said.</p><p>“My daughter is in heaven. She’s with God,” Diana’s mother, Rita Hernandez, <a class="LinkWrapper LinkWrapper--external" href=#>told WINK after the discovery.</a> “I don’t wish this upon anybody, on nobody because it wasn’t her fault.”</p><p>Jorge Guerrero-Torres, a 32-year-old family friend who previously admitted to sexually assaulting the girl, was <a class="LinkWrapper LinkWrapper--external" href=#>indicted</a> by a grand jury on a first-degree murder charge on May 3, 2018, in connection with Alvarez’s disappearance. He has been previously convicted on child pornography charges related to the case and is currently serving a 40-year prison sentence.&nbsp;</p><p>The State Attorney’s office will now seek the death penalty for Guerrero, who has been awaiting trial on the murder charge, a spokesperson told The Daily Beast.&nbsp;</p><p>“The monster that committed this horrendous crime is behind bars and will now be brought to justice for the murder of Diana Alvarez,” Lee County Sheriff Carmine Marceno <a class="LinkWrapper LinkWrapper--external" href=#>said during a Saturday news conference</a>. “This does not bring Diana back, but I hope this helps bring closure to the family.”</p><p>On May 29, 2016, authorities kicked off a massive, multi-county search that attracted hundreds of volunteers after the 9-year-old’s family reported her missing.&nbsp;</p><p>During the investigation, deputies discovered that Guerrero-Torres, then 28, had lived with the Alvarez family, but was kicked out after engaging in an “inappropriate relationship” with the 9-year-old child, authorities said. Investigators also discovered pornographic images of Alvarez on Guerrero-Torres’ phone.</p><p>According to <a class="LinkWrapper LinkWrapper--external" href=#>NBC Miami</a>, Guerrero-Torres made “admissions” during a police interview early in the investigation that put him with Alvarez the morning she went missing. He also admitted to having had sexual contact with the girl on a weekly basis for several months.&nbsp;</p><p>In August 2017, about a year after Alvarez’s disappearance, Guerrero-Torres was convicted of several federal child pornography charges related to the photographs of Alvarez and sentenced to 40 years in prison.&nbsp;</p><p>Despite the momentous discovery of Alvarez’s body, Guerrero-Torres’ murder case will not go to court for several months because of new court restrictions prompted by the COVID-19 pandemic.&nbsp;</p><p><a class="LinkWrapper LinkWrapper--external" href=#>During a case management hearing on Monday</a>, Lee County Circuit courtroom Judge Margaret O. Steinbeck requested a month-long delay after both prosecutors and the defense expressed difficulties with travel, gathering evidence for the trial, and completing the autopsy report for the 9-year-old due to the coronavirus.&nbsp;</p><p>The Lee County Clerk of Court also told The Daily Beast on Tuesday all jury selection for upcoming criminal trials will be suspended for at least three weeks.</p><p>Guerrero-Torres is set to return to court on April 27.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEnZiipKmXsqK%2F02eaqKVfmbaiusBmmKWukaeyu7%2BMq5ymmZmjwG6yzq6lnWWRm8GmvoyynJqqo2K5sLrGZqqemaKYtQ%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestD - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
