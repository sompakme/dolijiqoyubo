"They have been the most wonderful years of our lives, and thanks to that love and the respect that we share for one another we have been an exceptional couple and partners. "We move forward as partners, developing projects together, working hand in hand and in close communication. "Our friendship and understanding of one another is unwavering and indestructible."&nbsp;</p><p id=eTLOqXdVP4Q data-wc=61>Towards the end of last year there were rumours Shakira was seeing Barcelona FC player Gerard Pique, but she denied them. "Me and Pique together? That's a waka-rumour," she said – referring to her World Cup song .The footballer himself has also put paid to the stories. "Shakira and I are just friends, there's nothing more" he said this week.</p><p id=eo9kvNYmQMx data-wc=106>Shakira met Antonio in Buenos Aires in 2000 when he was working on his father's election campaign and she was promoting an album. They started dating soon after and since then have maintained a stable and discrete relationship away from the spotlight. The lawyer has been a constant at her side as she travels the world and has been instrumental in the finance side of her career. He had a key role in negotiating her Live Aid contract – a ten-year deal worth between $70 and $100 million. Shakira has said in numerous interviews that the pair were ready to settle down and start a family.</p><h2 class="newsletterTitleClass_nlzr60o hm-heading">Sign up to HELLO Daily! for the best royal, celebrity and lifestyle coverage</h2><span class=newsletterDisclaimerClass_ncg5smk><p>By entering your details, you are agreeing to HELLO!
