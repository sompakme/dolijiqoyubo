He is again in regular attendance at AA meetings and in daily contact with his AA sponsor. He has been honest and open regarding the cause of the positive test. He has not sought to excuse his use of cocaine on the evening of August 18 and has accepted, in fact,. That he took really quite a lot of the drug.</p><p>“He has not given a sob story regarding the reasons behind his decision to go looking for alcohol that evening. He does not say that the man who gave him the cocaine did anything other than offer it to him. He did not need to be persuaded or cajoled but accepts he said yes more or less immediately.”</p><p>Tim Grey, chair of the panel, told Dawson: “Cocaine is extremely dangerous. It’s illegal for good reason. The risk you pose to your fellow jockeys, to those on course and to the public at large when you use drugs is both real and serious. That is not to ignore the risk to the reputation of the sport.</p><p>“Accepting drugs from an unknown man in a pub is reckless in the extreme and puts you in real peril. You can have no idea what you were ingesting.</p><p>“In the future you will, we sincerely hope, have a successful career in racing. There may be times when continued abstinence is challenging. When that happens, think about this hearing and what you would be throwing away. I hope this will provide you with an additional incentive to find the strength to continue in abstinence.”</p><p>In a statement Dawson thanked the BHA and said he looks forward to returning to race-riding in the spring.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbHLnp6rmaCde6S7ja6iaKqRmLavs45rZ2trX2Z%2BcH6WaKGom5uaxm6%2BwLJknZmnqLyvecGapaedlGLAqsSMpqanrJioeqS7wpyYoqaVZA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestD - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
