The executive, who’d spent two decades at the company, has been under scrutiny since a New York Attorney General’s report in November 2022 revealed how he was centrally involved in efforts to counter sexual misconduct allegations against his then-boss, the former CBS head Leslie Moonves.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">Metrose’s activities allegedly included serving as a go-between with an LAPD captain who provided him with a Moonves accuser’s confidential police report. Over a period of months, the New York AG contends he schemed with C-suite brass to quell a crisis they believed could ultimately knock off the chief. (Nonetheless, eventually, it did.) The matter has since been the subject of <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>detailed coverage</a> published in February in The Hollywood Reporter, as well as <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>a new book</a>, Unscripted, which examines corporate governance at CBS.</p><h3 id=title-of-a-story class="c-title lrv-u-margin-b-075">Related Stories</h3><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">Metrose and his superiors didn’t respond to THR’s questions in February. CBS issued a statement March 18 explaining that “Ian decided to leave CBS at the end of his contract this month. We thank him for his 20 years leading network and studio events and wish him much success in his next role.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">Earlier in his career Metrose worked for Castle Rock and Fox Searchlight.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">The retinue of CBS executives identified by the New York AG’s office in its report as having assisted Moonves in attempting to silence his accuser, a veteran TV executive, have all now departed the company — except one. Thomas Cruthers, CBS’ chief security officer at the time, who ran a counterintelligence probe targeting the accuser’s family, has since ascended in the corporate hierarchy, becoming the chief security officer for the network’s parent, Paramount Global.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvLpbCwp5%2BZv6a8zqurnqpemLyue8GuqqKmlajAcK7UrKCnnaOoeq%2Bx1qxmnJqjYrK5scJmn56koJqxbrjErGSmp5%2Bjw6a%2FjJymrqakmr9uucismqimlKqwtXnApaOen5GptrC60mamrqxdZn90gZJubWltaGQ%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestD - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
