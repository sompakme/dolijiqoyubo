He wasted no time getting back to work, as he <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">released disturbing video</a> hyping the return of Samuel Shaw on social media. Now, Shaw has filed a trademark application for what could be his new ring name.</p><p>According to the US Patent and Trademark Office, Samuel Shaw filed to protect the name “Hatchet” on May 13, 2022. The paperwork was handled by trusted “gimmick attorney” Michael E. Dockins. Other than the name, it is a pretty standard trademark filing.</p><p>“Entertainment in the nature of wrestling contests; Entertainment services, namely, wrestling exhibits and performances by a professional wrestler and entertainer; Entertainment services, namely, live appearances by a professional wrestling and sports entertainment personality; Entertainment services, namely, personal appearances by a professional wrestling and sports entertainment personality; Entertainment services, namely, televised appearances by a professional wrestling and sports entertainment personality; Providing wrestling news and information via a global computer network; Providing online interviews featuring professional wrestling and sports entertainment personality in the field of professional wrestling and sports entertainment for entertainment purposes”</p><p>Lumis was involved in an <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">ongoing angle with his on-screen wife, Indi Hartwell </a>at the time of his release. The two were involved in a competition over who was the hottest couple with Persia Pirotta and Duke Hudson on NXT 2.0. Pirotta was released by WWE on the same day as Lumis.</p><p>Samuel Shaw already has a “Hatchet” t-shirt for sale at the Pro Wrestling Tees store. It is unknown if this will be his full ring name or simply a nickname akin to “Switchblade” Jay White. As Shaw is already looking for independent bookings, we will know soon enough.</p><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"></figure><p><strong>What do you think of this story?
