By the time he was 19, Yachty was <a href=#>modeling for YEEZY</a> and putting out Billboard-charting singles — he had to grow up fast, and so did his wardrobe.</p><p class="paragraph___RlNzb paragraph-paragraph10___NmvOh contentParagraph___u9L2Q paragraph___bcvQh">Over a relatively brief span of time, Yachty’s personal style has evolved both dramatically and quickly.</p><p class="paragraph___RlNzb paragraph-paragraph10___NmvOh contentParagraph___u9L2Q paragraph___bcvQh">Less than a decade ago, in the early days of Yachty’s career, he possessed a rudimentary approach to getting dressed that nevertheless suggested an air of innate confidence. In recent years, Yachty has matured to an intellectual blend of curated vintage and designer gear that’s all his own.</p><p class="paragraph___RlNzb paragraph-paragraph10___NmvOh contentParagraph___u9L2Q paragraph___bcvQh">You can visibly draw throughlines between young Yachty and contemporary Yachty, which speaks to his fashion prescience. To get better at clothes over time is normal, to have always had it is sublime.</p><p class="paragraph___RlNzb paragraph-paragraph10___NmvOh contentParagraph___u9L2Q paragraph___bcvQh">These days, Yachty affects advanced silhouettes with such ease that you’d be forgiven for not immediately being struck by their potency. Baggy, colorful, and marked by less-obvious designer accents; everything Yachty wears is <a href=#>dripping with intent</a>. If he flexes a logo, for instance, he does so with reasons beyond broadcasting wealth.</p><p class="paragraph___RlNzb paragraph-paragraph10___NmvOh contentParagraph___u9L2Q paragraph___bcvQh">And, it’s not just the clothes but Yachty’s subtle styling decisions that elevate his looks. It’s the intentionality of his accessories, the slouch of an oversized shirt, the way he dictates pant-shoe interaction. In other words: It’s the Yachty-isms that take his outfits to the next level.</p><p class="paragraph___RlNzb paragraph-paragraph10___NmvOh contentParagraph___u9L2Q paragraph___bcvQh">Yachty, like most well-dressed folks, presumably makes these choices in mere moments, yet each choice represents the accumulation of years' worth of styling inclinations and are thus also years in the making.</p><p class="paragraph___RlNzb paragraph-paragraph10___NmvOh contentParagraph___u9L2Q paragraph___bcvQh">Here, I've chronicled some of his most pivotal style decisions to create a timeline loosely dubbed calling "Yachty’s stylistic evolution." Soak in Yachty's visible growth and then <a href=#>read our cover story</a> with Yachty from Highsnobiety's September 2023 issue.</p><p class="paragraph___RlNzb paragraph-paragraph10___NmvOh contentParagraph___u9L2Q paragraph___bcvQh"><strong>October 15, 2016</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.highsnobiety.com/data:image/jpeg;base64><p class="paragraph___RlNzb paragraph-paragraph10___NmvOh contentParagraph___u9L2Q paragraph___bcvQh">A young Yachty hits the red carpet. You can see a glimmering of the taste already at play in his varsity jacket — a Yachty signature — and the funky eyewear.</p><p class="paragraph___RlNzb paragraph-paragraph10___NmvOh contentParagraph___u9L2Q paragraph___bcvQh"><strong>February 12, 2017</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p class="paragraph___RlNzb paragraph-paragraph10___NmvOh contentParagraph___u9L2Q paragraph___bcvQh">A prep’d up Yachty displays the slimmer cuts that once dictated his wardrobe.</p><p class="paragraph___RlNzb paragraph-paragraph10___NmvOh contentParagraph___u9L2Q paragraph___bcvQh"><strong>June 24, 2017</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p class="paragraph___RlNzb paragraph-paragraph10___NmvOh contentParagraph___u9L2Q paragraph___bcvQh">Two years before his BAPE collab, Yachty already had his eye on the prize.</p><p class="paragraph___RlNzb paragraph-paragraph10___NmvOh contentParagraph___u9L2Q paragraph___bcvQh"><strong>September 11, 2017</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p class="paragraph___RlNzb paragraph-paragraph10___NmvOh contentParagraph___u9L2Q paragraph___bcvQh">Not the wildest look but two big takeaways: that Yachty was at Shayne Oliver’s Helmut Lang fashion show speaks to his appreciation for interesting clothes and, again, a solid vintage statement piece.</p><p class="paragraph___RlNzb paragraph-paragraph10___NmvOh contentParagraph___u9L2Q paragraph___bcvQh"><strong>October 6, 2017</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p class="paragraph___RlNzb paragraph-paragraph10___NmvOh contentParagraph___u9L2Q paragraph___bcvQh">Here’s where things get interesting. We can see a real inkling of Yachty’s preference for luxurious clothing worn loose ‘n easy.</p><p class="paragraph___RlNzb paragraph-paragraph10___NmvOh contentParagraph___u9L2Q paragraph___bcvQh"><strong>October 28, 2018</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p class="paragraph___RlNzb paragraph-paragraph10___NmvOh contentParagraph___u9L2Q paragraph___bcvQh">On the cusp of NEEDLES’ tracksuit getting its moment in the sun, Yachty had long been riding the wave. Note the complementary Kangol hat.</p><p class="paragraph___RlNzb paragraph-paragraph10___NmvOh contentParagraph___u9L2Q paragraph___bcvQh"><strong>November 10, 2018</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p class="paragraph___RlNzb paragraph-paragraph10___NmvOh contentParagraph___u9L2Q paragraph___bcvQh">Yachty’s first (but not last) Thom Browne, a refinement of the slimmer cuts he’d preferred up to this point.</p><p class="paragraph___RlNzb paragraph-paragraph10___NmvOh contentParagraph___u9L2Q paragraph___bcvQh"><strong>December 3, 2018</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p class="paragraph___RlNzb paragraph-paragraph10___NmvOh contentParagraph___u9L2Q paragraph___bcvQh">Everyone has a Pharrell phase. Actually, is it really a phase when Pharrell is still one of the most influential dudes in phashion?</p><p class="paragraph___RlNzb paragraph-paragraph10___NmvOh contentParagraph___u9L2Q paragraph___bcvQh"><strong>March 24, 2019</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p class="paragraph___RlNzb paragraph-paragraph10___NmvOh contentParagraph___u9L2Q paragraph___bcvQh">With his frayed bucket hat and studded denim shorts, Yachty’s look here is bordering on something he’d probably wear now, except that it could be a bit baggier.</p><p class="paragraph___RlNzb paragraph-paragraph10___NmvOh contentParagraph___u9L2Q paragraph___bcvQh"><strong>February 10, 2020</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p class="paragraph___RlNzb paragraph-paragraph10___NmvOh contentParagraph___u9L2Q paragraph___bcvQh">Likewise, the Denim Tears sweatsuit never goes outta style. Of particular interest is how Yachty’s wearing’ it big without drowning in it.</p><p class="paragraph___RlNzb paragraph-paragraph10___NmvOh contentParagraph___u9L2Q paragraph___bcvQh"><strong>September 9, 2020</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p class="paragraph___RlNzb paragraph-paragraph10___NmvOh contentParagraph___u9L2Q paragraph___bcvQh">By late 2020, we’ve essentially arrived at contemporary Yachty. The pieces of the puzzle are all in place: the hat, the shirt, the work pants. You can tell that, right before the COVID-19 pandemic, Yachty was workshopping his wardrobe enough that, with months of lockdown allowing ample time to gather inspiration, Yachty had dialed it all in by year’s end.</p><p class="paragraph___RlNzb paragraph-paragraph10___NmvOh contentParagraph___u9L2Q paragraph___bcvQh"><strong>January 12, 2021</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p class="paragraph___RlNzb paragraph-paragraph10___NmvOh contentParagraph___u9L2Q paragraph___bcvQh">This is everything you need to know about Lil Yachty’s taste, right here. Head-turning hat, varsity jacket, massive trousers. This is as much a mission statement as it is an outfit.</p><p class="paragraph___RlNzb paragraph-paragraph10___NmvOh contentParagraph___u9L2Q paragraph___bcvQh"><strong>July 23, 2021</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p class="paragraph___RlNzb paragraph-paragraph10___NmvOh contentParagraph___u9L2Q paragraph___bcvQh">Another archetypal Yachty look. Big silhouette informed by aspirationally fun pieces, like the Stüssy x CPFM pants worn without try-hard effort.</p><p class="paragraph___RlNzb paragraph-paragraph10___NmvOh contentParagraph___u9L2Q paragraph___bcvQh"><strong>October 29, 2021</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p class="paragraph___RlNzb paragraph-paragraph10___NmvOh contentParagraph___u9L2Q paragraph___bcvQh">This is an important outfit. It simultaneously underscores Yachty’s mastery of oversizing his clothes and highlights a growing affection for Raf Simons.</p><p class="paragraph___RlNzb paragraph-paragraph10___NmvOh contentParagraph___u9L2Q paragraph___bcvQh"><strong>January 22, 2022</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p class="paragraph___RlNzb paragraph-paragraph10___NmvOh contentParagraph___u9L2Q paragraph___bcvQh">Dare to compare this Yachty outfit to the one he wore at the end of 2020. You can see how, by now, he’s perfected the look, retaining the hat shape while loosening up throughout, even experimenting with madcap furry slides. Because that’s just what you do when you’re in the zone.</p><p class="paragraph___RlNzb paragraph-paragraph10___NmvOh contentParagraph___u9L2Q paragraph___bcvQh"><strong>April 15, 2022</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p class="paragraph___RlNzb paragraph-paragraph10___NmvOh contentParagraph___u9L2Q paragraph___bcvQh">And then, Yachty steps out in a real statement piece: an archival Raf Simons Virginia Creeper digicamo hoodie — the rarer, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">more expensive</a>, and most coveted iteration of Simons’ FW02 patterned knitwear — paired with Rick Owens pants. Yachty’s archival era is cemented.</p><p class="paragraph___RlNzb paragraph-paragraph10___NmvOh contentParagraph___u9L2Q paragraph___bcvQh"><strong>July 28, 2023</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p class="paragraph___RlNzb paragraph-paragraph10___NmvOh contentParagraph___u9L2Q paragraph___bcvQh">Even though we now know where Yachty’s at, it’s refreshing to see how he’s still pushing himself stylistically. Here, he demonstrates his fascination with up-and-coming designers with a custom leather get-up made for him by <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">Gruppo Vava</a>. The resulting outfit speaks to Yachty’s willingness to look beyond conventional luxury labels, a crucial element of anyone pushing the stylistic envelope.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbXGoaqnp5KesrXFjZympmegZLmquIyymJygpK56tMDYpZxmnaakubbAyKilaA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestD - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
