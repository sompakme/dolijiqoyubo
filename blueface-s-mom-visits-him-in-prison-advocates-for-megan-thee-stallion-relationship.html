Moreover, she recently pleaded with <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Kim Kardashian</a> to help advocate for his freedom, and of course shaded his on-and-off-again volatile boo <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Chrisean Rock</a> in the process. However, the rapper's mother is also making it clear that her support is not just on social media, but right there with him. TMZ caught up with her this week at Los Angeles' Men's Central Jail, where he's currently held until at least this summer. Not only that, but Karlissa is already thinking about his future.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Furthermore, she reiterated one of her common sentiments that made headlines previously. Karlissa Saffold thinks <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Megan Thee Stallion</a> should get with Blueface, and thinks <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">she'd be the perfect partner</a> for when he's released. Unsurprisingly, she shaded the 27-year-old's past partners who she thinks brought him down, and thinks the Houston MC is more his speed. His mother wants them to travel Europe together, and even brought up their compatible astrological signs as another proposed piece of evidence.</p><span><h2 class="__className_a6f35b font-bold text-2xl lg:text-[2.125rem] mb-[18px] font-poppins leading-10" id=h-karlissa-saffold-cheers-for-megan-thee-stallion-fling-while-visiting-blueface>Karlissa Saffold Cheers For Megan Thee Stallion Fling While Visiting Blueface</h2></span><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">However, even in Karlissa Saffold doesn't like Chrisean Rock, she'll still defend her son with Blueface against all opponents, including <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Soulja Boy</a>'s <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">disparaging comments</a> about Chrisean Jr. "Y’all should not be talking about nobody’s baby," she expressed on social media.&nbsp;"That’ll come back on your grandbaby. That’s off limits, that’s short man syndrome because that baby is bigger than Soulja Boy already! That’s why he’s mad. He wouldn’t say his gang affiliation on the internet, but he talking about kids. That’s just giving a m*dget on drugs."</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Meanwhile, Karlissa Saffold also spent some time defending Tina Snow from Tokyo Toni's disses. "I'll say this one time and one time only, Ms. Tokyo," she expressed. "<a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">Don't f**k with Megan</a>. Her mama not here to take up for her, don't f**k with her.&nbsp;She's off-limits.&nbsp;Unless you want me to pull up and do you how I did you on that Zeus Network. That's all I've got to say today."

Whether it’s regular coverage or occasional interviews and album reviews, he continues to search for the most relevant news for his audience and find the best new releases in the genre. What excites him the most is finding pop culture stories of interest, as well as a deeper passion for the art form of hip-hop and its contemporary output.

Before working at HotNewHipHop, Gabriel produced multiple short documentaries, artist interviews, venue spotlights, and audio podcasts on a variety of genres and musical figures. Hardcore punk and Go-go music defined much of his coverage during his time at the George Washington University in D.C.
