"The heat can be applied by using a plastic cap over the hair under a pre-heated hooded dryer, or a steamer without a cap," she advises. "The heat allows the cuticle to expand and allows the conditioner to penetrate the hair strands." Then, she recommends washing the conditioner out with lukewarm water. This cap, which is lined with terry cloth, is perfect for comfortably sitting under a steamer or hooded dryer.</p><p><strong>Pros: </strong>Lined for a comfortable fit; Keeps hair securely inside; Helps hair retain moisture</p><p><strong>Cons: </strong>Must be washed frequently</p><h2 class=article-body__section id=section-what-causes-low-porosity-hair><span>What Causes Low-Porosity Hair?</span></h2><p>A mixture of nature and nurture determines one's hair porosity, so it's important to note how changes to your routine and environment impact your hair health. "Heat styling tools, such as flat irons and blow dryers, can damage the hair cuticle, putting you at higher risk for low-porosity hair," Sims says. He adds that if you don't wash your hair frequently, you may foster low-porosity hair because of the amount of product buildup.</p><p>"Hair porosity is also largely determined by genetics. If you have family members with low-porosity hair, there's a good chance you will too," he explains. "Something not many people know is that someone can have a mixture of both low- and <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-before-rewrite-localise=https://www.marieclaire.com/beauty/high-porosity-hair/>high-porosity hair.</a>" The latter often is displayed by dryness and damage, so if you feel you have combination porosity, be sure to prioritize hydration while avoiding buildup.</p><h2 class=article-body__section id=section-what-to-look-for-in-low-porosity-hair-products><span>What to Look For in Low-Porosity Hair Products</span></h2><ul><li><strong>Lightweight Textures</strong></li></ul><p>Bailey suggests that people with low-porosity hair gravitate towards lightweight ingredients. "Water-based products that can easily penetrate the hair are great choices," Sims adds.</p><p>"If the product has oil in it, look for lightweight oils like jojoba, babassu, black seed oil, argan or aloe vera," says Bailey. "These oils all have a good comedogenic rating, which means they won’t clog the skin's pores." Sims adds that honey and glycerin are also great for hydrating low-porosity hair from the inside out without weighing it down.</p><h2 class=article-body__section id=section-what-to-avoid-in-low-porosity-hair-products><span>What to Avoid in Low-Porosity Hair Products</span></h2><p>Both Bailey and Sims recommend steering clear of protein-packed products, explaining that people with low-porosity hair can be protein-sensitive. This means that too much protein would result in buildup, moisture retention issues, and a weighed-down look.</p><p>Because low-porosity hair needs an environment that facilitates moisture absorption, Bailey advises avoiding heavy butters and creams. They can sit on top of the hair shaft and cause buildup. For instance, options like olive oil and castor oil may be too heavy. "Additionally, avoiding silicones is wise because they create a barrier and sit on top of the hair, making it difficult for the hair to absorb moisture," she adds.</p><h3 class=article-body__section id=section-meet-the-experts><span>Meet the Experts</span></h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/dGy7cg7Z9St7BWmhFKmWxj-1920-80.png><span class=person__name>Alicia Bailey</span><a class=button-social href=# aria-label=INSTAGRAM><span class=button-social__icon></span></a><a class=button-social href=# aria-label=WEBSITE><span class="button-social__icon button-social__icon-website"></span></a>Licensed Master Cosmetologist<p>Alicia Bailey is a licensed master cosmetologist and the CEO and Global Hair Education Director at <a href=#>Iman Yvonne Beauty</a> with over 30 years of experience.
