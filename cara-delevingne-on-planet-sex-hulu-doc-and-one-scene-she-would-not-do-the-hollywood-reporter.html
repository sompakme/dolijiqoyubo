This is the lube,” said Delevingne, speaking at <a href=# id=auto-tag_international_1 data-tag=international>international</a> TV market <a href=# id=auto-tag_mipcom_1 data-tag=mipcom>MIPCOM</a> on Tuesday. “I didn’t realize I was a prude [but] I was like, ‘Sorry, what? Sorry, no, absolutely not, I will not do that.’ But I kind of did everything I felt comfortable doing.”</p><h3 id=title-of-a-story class="c-title lrv-u-margin-b-075">Related Stories</h3><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">Delevingne opened up about her personal journey making Planet Sex at a presentation for the show at MIPCOM, which included a 10-minute preview of the first episode. (Attendees were forbidden from filming during the entire one-hour session).</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">“Every day [on the Planet Sex shoot] was completely different,” Delevingne said. “I’m used to being a chameleon, but this was absurd. One day you’re going to get your blood taken while having an orgasm, the next day you’re going to a porn library. I was like, ‘Right, OK, screw my head back on.'”</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">Each episode of the series sees Delevingne explore a big question about sexuality — in the words of <a href=# id=auto-tag_fremantle_1 data-tag=fremantle>Fremantle</a> U.K. boss Simon Andreae, who first came up with the concept for the show — “through laboratories, different cultures, different individuals, her own mind and body, [to] come out the other end with a conclusion.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">Andreae said the series wanted to avoid the “classic Hollywood fence-sitting because you don’t want to offend anyone” and reach real conclusions about sexual orientation. Which, he said, was that “sexual orientation is finished by the time you’re born.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">Delevingne seems to agree. In the first few minutes of the Planet Sex clip shown at MIPCOM, Delevingne notes that she is “100 percent” queer.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">Delevingne is producing Planet Sex together with Fremantle through her Milkshake Productions banner for Hulu and the <a href=# id=auto-tag_bbc_1 data-tag=bbc>BBC</a>. The series, which Fremantle has presold to more than 92 markets around the world, will premiere on Hulu later this year.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvLpbCwp5%2BZv6a8zqurnqpemLyue9OvZq2uXaOyuL%2BOnJirmV2Zsq2x1aKloKaVYr2trc2eq2arla16qcHLrmSdp5OqwKa%2ByJ6qZqWZpbCwuYxrZ2tqXWZ%2FdIGRbWpvbGVk</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestD - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
