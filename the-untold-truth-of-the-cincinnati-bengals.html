Much of this had to do with their sheer inability to rebuild through the draft.</p><p>To be fair, the Bengals had their share of draft busts before the 1990s â€” Jack Thompson and two-time Heisman Trophy winner Archie Griffin immediately come to mind. But as <a href=#>Cincy Jungle</a> documented, the '90s were a brutal decade for Cincinnati in the NFL Draft. Quarterbacks David Klingler (No. 6, 1992) and Akili Smith (No. 3, 1999) only lasted a few seasons with the Bengals and produced pedestrian numbers behind center. Running back Ki-Jana Carter (No. 1, 1995, pictured above) showed flashes of brilliance, but injuries prematurely ended what could have been a great career. And while defensive tackle Dan "Big Daddy"&nbsp;Wilkinson (No. 1, 1994) had a solid career, as noted by <a href=#>The Sports Daily</a>, he didn't quite live up to the expectations of a first overall pick.&nbsp;Then you've got the Bengals' busts from the early 2000s, a list that most notably includes wide receiver Peter Warrick (No. 4, 2000).</p><p>With all that said, the Bengals are very fortunate that Joe Burrow has lived up to his draft billing so far, unlike all the other names we mentioned above.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qL7Up56eZpOkunCDlG9nbmxfqbWmedSnq6iklGLBs8HToWSonl2ptaZ5wqKlnKGeo661tYybnKefkaHAcA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestD - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
