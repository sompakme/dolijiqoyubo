One image shows Lourdes – affectionately called Lola by her family and friends – with her arms and legs wrapped around a person as they perform a death-defying stunt on the bike, with Lourdes still managing to look incredible with her long dark hair blowing in the wind.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/5d3d0eaac7d4-lourdes-leon-motorbike.jpg><p id=eW7wHCbp986 data-wc=45>Another photo sees her crouching down beside the bike and seductively looking over her shoulder while giving a glimpse of her derriere in the thong two-piece, while a third image shows her posing on the bike in her revealing swimwear that almost exposes her chest.</p><p id=evDOGmc4Kk data-wc=34>Speaking to the magazine, the model admitted that she relies "so heavily on my body as a means of expression", while also opening up about her sexuality and her relationship with her famous mom.&nbsp;</p><h4 class="relatedContentTitleClass_r14hzpr7 hm-heading">You may also like</h4><p id=e7rg34TsIA data-wc=56><strong>"I don't like girls. I'm painfully straight, it's terrible… I am cursed, plagued with liking these men,"</strong> she said. Speaking of growing up with Madonna, Lourdes added:<strong>&nbsp;"I feel like I was so well-behaved. But I don't know, maybe my mom would say otherwise. I feel like I would have gotten spanked if I wasn't well-behaved."&nbsp;</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/856eacd74859-lourdes-leon-motorbike-bikini.jpg><p id=eo5OkNOiPIB data-wc=44>Like her mom, Lourdes is a trained dancer and has been making a name for herself lately as a sought-after model. She is also following in Madonna's footsteps as a singer and in November, she released her debut EP, Go, under the moniker Lolahol.&nbsp;</p><p id=eBi5xvnD6Mj data-wc=61>Lourdes is the oldest of Madonna's six children, and the pair have an incredibly close bond. In 1998, Madonna recorded Little Star on her Ray of Light album as a tribute to her daughter, and in 2012 the pair sang the song together on her MDNA tour; Lourdes also made an appearance via video installation during the 2019 Madame X tour.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/798b37f12e87-lourdes-leon-bikini.jpg><p id=eCMYoKaY9eI data-wc=33>Madonna shares Lourdes with ex-boyfriend <strong>Carlos Leon</strong> and also has a son Rocco with ex-husband <strong>Guy Ritchie</strong>.

Talking to <a class=hm-link href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Vogue</a>, she said her daughter was "insanely talented". She said: "I'm green with envy because she's incredible at everything she does – she's an incredible dancer, she's a great actress, she plays the piano beautifully, she's way better than me in the talent department."&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/33adc5a69a18-lourdes-leon-bikini-the-face.jpg><p id=eM8hvq-Mhb5 data-wc=54>Madonna added: "But does she have the same drive that I have? No. But she also has a mother, and I didn't. She grew up with money, and I didn't. So everything is going to be different. But what can I do? I can't fixate on it.
