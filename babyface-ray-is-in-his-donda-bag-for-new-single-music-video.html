That same year, he gave us his FACE album featuring <a href=# class=text-word rel>Pusha T</a> and <a href=# class=text-word rel>Wiz Khalifa</a>, as well as singles like "Drive By" with <a href=# class=text-word rel>Harry Fraud</a> and <a href=# class=text-word rel>French Montana</a> plus <a href=# rel>"MOB"</a> in December. The Detroit native has steadily kept the fire coming in 2023, collaborating with names such as Shady <a href=# class=text-word rel>Blu</a>, 42 Dugg, and Payroll Giovanni.</p><p>Back in June, Babyface gave us a solo effort called "All Star Team," which arrived to rave reviews. Today (July 7), the 32-year-old is following that up with "Donda Bag" and its accompanying visual. As per Rap Radar, it was directed by Kardiak, and shows the talented lyricst putting together a fashion show while rhyming about his sometimes exuberant spending habits.

"Donda Bag" runs just over three minutes. Production came together thanks to the rapper's frequent collaborator, Space. It's expected to appear on his upcoming third album, along with singles like <a href=# rel>"Ron Artest"</a> and "Goofies," though nothing has been confirmed at this time.</p><p>Check out the "Donda Bag" visual above, or add it to your playlist on <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Spotify</a>/<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Apple Music</a>.
