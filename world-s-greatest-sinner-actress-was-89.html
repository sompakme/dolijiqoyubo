The film has rarely been seen in theaters and is perhaps best known for its Zappa connection. <a href=# id=auto-tag_martin-scorsese_1 data-tag=martin-scorsese>Martin Scorsese</a> is said to be a fan.</p><h3 id=title-of-a-story class="c-title lrv-u-margin-b-075">Related Stories</h3><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">In the 2012 making-of documentary Making Sinner, Sturm was interviewed by Romeo Carey, Timothy Carey’s son. She explained that because of The World’s Greatest Sinner‘s yearlong shooting schedule and a financial dispute, she did not return for one last scene, so an extra stepped in for her to play a saxophone.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">Raised in Spain and Germany, Sturm came to Los Angeles in the late 1950s and lived at the Hollywood Studio Club dormitory started years earlier by Mary Pickford. Actresses <a href=# id=auto-tag_kim-novak_1 data-tag=kim-novak>Kim Novak</a>, Jo Anne Worley and Pat Priest also lived there at the time.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">According to her son, Sturm went on a double date with <a href=# id=auto-tag_elvis-presley_1 data-tag=elvis-presley>Elvis Presley</a> to see <a href=# id=auto-tag_alfred-hitchcock_1 data-tag=alfred-hitchcock>Alfred Hitchcock</a>’s Psycho (1960) at a drive-in, but the couples left during the shower scene because the singer “couldn’t stand the sight of onscreen blood.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">In the early 1970s, Sturm sold custom wigs and hairpieces for park characters at <a href=# id=auto-tag_disneyland_1 data-tag=disneyland>Disneyland</a> — she supplied wigs for The Pirates of the Caribbean ride — and for actors appearing in Disney films. She worked with Joy Zapata at Disneyland and Bob Schiffer at Walt Disney Productions in Burbank, her son said.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">She also ran the Elizabeth Sturm Talent Agency, booking actors for commercials, films and television starting in the 1990s.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">Sturm was married to Robert Winckler, a prolific child actor turned entertainment attorney who appeared in Little Rascals/Our Gang comedies and films including Pride of the Yankees, from 1962 until his death in 1989.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">In addition to her son, a producer, director and novelist, survivors include her daughter, Patricia, son-in-law Jim and grandchildren Michelle and Robert.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvLpbCwp5%2BZv6a8zqurnqpemLyue8yoraKdo2S6sMLInmSnnaeofKOx062wZqukqr%2BuecOemJ1lp6S%2FrbDSZp6rnZGpsrTAjKygp6aVp3pyfpJuamlvYmuAcA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestD - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
