Together, they plot their revenge. Game of Thrones‘ <strong>Nikolaj Coster-Waldau</strong> plays the role of the husband.</p><p><a href=# rel=noopener><strong>PHOTOS:&nbsp;‘The Other Woman Premiere’– Cameron Diaz, Leslie Mann and <a href=# id=auto-tag_kate-upton data-tag=kate-upton>Kate Upton</a> Dazzle on the Carpet</strong></a></p><p>“I hate when the media tries to pit women against one another,” Diaz told The Hollywood Reporter, wearing a low-cut black minidress. “It’s not what is actually happening.” Diaz, who recently co-wrote and published Body Book, which focuses on positive and healthy living, found the same appeal in <strong>Melissa Stack</strong>‘s script for The Other Woman,&nbsp;where the message is to “take care of yourself,” Diaz said. “It’s a story about female friendship. Three women become friends and don’t fight over a lying, cheating man. They realize it’s not worth it. Instead, they come to each other’s rescue and help one another through heartbreak.”</p><p>“The more we know about ourselves and understand about one another, the better the world would be,” she added.</p><p>Model <strong>Kate Upton</strong>, who has previous played minor roles in The Three Stooges and Tower Heist, co-stars as one of the husband’s “other women.” She told The Hollywood Reporter the “female friendship” theme of the script appealed to her. “You need girlfriends through hard times in your life,” she said, wearing a sparkling silver Dolce & Gabbana&nbsp;dress. “I know I do. I hope to continue to do acting,” the 21-year-old added. “It’s awesome to have Cameron and Leslie in my life. They’re my true friends.”</p><p>Directed by <strong>Nick</strong> <strong>Cassavetes</strong>, who was out of town for the premiere, The Other Woman recently won a ratings appeal. Earlier this month, Diaz appeared at a hearing with 20th&nbsp;Century Fox executives to argue that the movie’s rating should be changed from R to PG-13. “I respect what the&nbsp;MPAA stands for,” Diaz said. “We need guidelines, and I appreciate that. But I thought, in this instance, it wasn’t the right ruling for our film.” Girls producer <strong><a href=# id=auto-tag_judd-apatow data-tag=judd-apatow>Judd Apatow</a>&nbsp;</strong>—&nbsp;Mann’s husband and father of two children — commented on American attitudes towards film nudity. “It’s interesting because there is more violence than sex scenes in PG-13 movies released here, yet overseas, there is not [as much] tolerance for violence as there is with nudity.”</p><p><strong><a href=# rel=noopener>STORY: Cameron Diaz, Fox Win Ratings Battle Over ‘The Other Woman’</a></strong></p><p>Following the premiere, the stars and fans headed to Westwood’s W Hotel for a reception. Mann enjoyed catching up with close friends and family in a corner of the room with her husband close by. Singer <strong>Nicki</strong> <strong>Minaj</strong>, who appeared in the film, arrived an hour later with a wardrobe change, accompanied by two strict bodyguards who did not permit any interaction between her and the press. Extra’s <strong>Maria Menounos</strong> also showed her support at the premiere and reception. Diaz and Upton skipped the party, while Coster-Waldau did not attend the premiere.</p><p>Chicago Fire‘s&nbsp;<strong>Taylor Kinney</strong>, who plays Mann’s brother in the film, told&nbsp;THR on the carpet that it was “almost a necessity to be there working with Cassavetes.</p><p>“The set was filled with estrogen; it was good to have another dude there,” joked Kinney. “In comedy, you have to be ready for anything. There is a lot of improvisation. It’s not something I do every day, so it was liberating.”</p><p>The Other Woman hits theaters on Friday, April 25.</p><h3 id=title-of-a-story class="c-title lrv-u-margin-b-075">Related Stories</h3><h3 id=title-of-a-story class="c-title lrv-u-margin-b-075">Related Stories</h3><h3 id=title-of-a-story class="c-title lrv-u-margin-b-075">Related Stories</h3><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvLpbCwp5%2BZv6a8zqurnqpemLyue82erqxnl5q7pr7ApWSnnaeofKStzJ6pqKZdmbaixoylnKykmZp6rq3Np2SepZKnrqSxjG9wcWlmbHw%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestD - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
