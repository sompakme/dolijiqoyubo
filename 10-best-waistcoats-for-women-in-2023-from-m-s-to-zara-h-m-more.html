The perfect middle ground between a tank or crop top and warmer winter pieces, they're ideal for layering as we move into autumn, making them the most worthy sartorial investment you can make right now.</p><p id=eCjGXBgDxxr data-wc=72>We spoke to London-based fashion stylist <a class=hm-link href=# rel=nofollow>Holly Coopey</a> about her thoughts on waistcoats having a style moment for autumn: "Waistcoats are a great transitional piece for layering," she said. "I love when masculine tailoring gives an androgynous look for my clients. What's more, the waistcoat can totally transform the simple jeans and tee look with a directional twist. The waistcoat also works over a printed midi dress for the ultimate 70s vibe."</p><p id=enQsNSFXdNi data-wc=27>Looking for a waistcoat to add to your fashion repetoire?

Granted, if you're looking to wear your waistcoat to work, that's fine, but you don't want to look like you're competing on The Apprentice. Pair yours with wide-leg trousers or a slip skirt, and most importantly? Channel your inner Kendall Jenner and wear it with confidence. Stylist Holly shared: "If you're looking for an easy way to lean into the suiting trend gently, wear on its own for a chic deconstructed tux look."</li><li>When you wear a waistcoat in the daytime add <a class=hm-link href=#>a pair of white trainers</a> to help keep the look casual. Keep your hair looking fuss-free - there's a time and a place for a bouncy blow-dry, but this isn't one of them. In fact, wearing your waistcoat with natural makeup and a slicked back bun is also a vibe we've seen on the cool girls of Instagram.</li><li>For a nighttime look, make it sexy. Think glossy skin, a chic bag (no office-style totes) and a pair of barely-there heels. Channel your inner Parisian. &nbsp;&nbsp;</li></ul><h4 class="relatedContentTitleClass_r14hzpr7 hm-heading">You may also like</h4><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbHLpaammZeWx6q6xGeaqKVfqLWwvM%2BipaBnZWV%2BeYWXaJmeq6RixKK10q2aqJmkqHqnu9FmrqillaN8</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestD - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
