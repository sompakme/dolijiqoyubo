When he was cast in a family dramedy in 1993, little did he know that the film would enjoy iconic status decades later, not to mention bountiful memes (who can forget the terrifying <a href=#>"Mrs. Doubtfire" horror movie trailer</a>?).</p><p dir=ltr>"Mrs. Doubtfire" was the perfect opportunity for Brosnan to showcase his comedic skills, even if he did spend the majority of the film being tortured by Robin Williams. Reflecting on the role, Brosnan told <a href=#>Esquire</a>, "[Robin] was brilliant. Sally was gorgeous. She and I got on like gas on fire. It was so delightfully enchanting. It was just delightful."</p><p dir=ltr>In that same interview, he recalls his first encounter with Williams, in which the star "was sitting at the end of the trailer in his Hawaiian shirt and his big hairy arms, and his hairy legs coming out of his cargo pants. But he had the head of Mrs. Doubtfire." In the voice of his female alter-ego, Williams proceeded to ask Brosnan for a smooch. As he recalled, Williams trilled, "Oh, you're so handsome. Oh, look at ya, Pierce. Oh, give us a kiss."</p><p dir=ltr>Years later, Brosnan still misses his late co-star, <a href=#>who died in 2014</a>. "His humanity was so far reaching, and joy of people, and love of life, bountiful. Oh, Robin, still, his passing still hurts deeply. I miss him," he reminisced poignantly to Esquire.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmb21ia4Z4e9OhnGasopa7tLLOq6SarJmku267xWanop2imLJurtGoqqeZnmKzs7vMZpqhoZyZtbC7w2arqGVmbXq6scCrqmannJl8</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestD - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
