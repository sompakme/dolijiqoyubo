However, Chloe tried her hand at love again with her ex, Mitchell Eason, when he entered the house, and Shayne didn’t have much luck elsewhere during her absence.</p><p>Ultimately, though, Chloe decided that she wanted to explore her relationship with Shayne more than she wanted to try and rekindle her romance with Mitchell, and the couple paired up once again.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><p>After surviving some bumps in the road, it looked as though Chloe and Shayne were headed toward their happily ever after.</p><p>So, are they still together?

Chloe and Shayne likely have restrictions as far as what they can and can’t share online, but neither has shared any romantic photos of the two of them on IG.</p><p>However, Chloe may have revealed on TikTok that she and Shayne are no longer an item. In a video recorded earlier this week, Chloe recorded herself with her “PERFECT MATCH TEAM,” as stated in her caption.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-tiktok wp-block-embed-tiktok"></figure><p>Chloe filmed herself with many of her castmates from Perfect Match, but Shayne wasn’t included in the video.</p><p>Another one of Shayne’s love interests, Natalie Lee, from Love Is Blind, recently shared a <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">TikTok</a> in which he was the topic.

Her comment read, “*No hate we love Shayne ❤️- we all just have one thing in common! ?.”</p><p>Although Chloe hasn’t explicitly stated whether she and Shayne are still a couple, she recently told <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">TODAY.com</a> that she hasn’t watched Perfect Match yet, and is dreading watching Shayne’s reaction after she decided to give it another go with Mitchell.</p><p>“I’m gonna see Shane hurting on the show when I watch it. So I’m probably gonna close my eyes for that. But (on a) competition dating show, these things happen,” Chloe said.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-who-won-perfect-match>Who won Perfect Match?</h2><p>The finale of Perfect Match just dropped this week on Netflix, and viewers learned that despite Chloe and Shayne’s onscreen chemistry, they weren’t voted the most compatible couple.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><p>Chloe and Shayne were among several other couples, including Bartise Bowden and Izzy Fairthorne, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Joey Sasso and Kariselle Snow</a>, Dom Gabriel and Georgia Hassarati, and Nick Uhlenhuth and Lauren “LC” Chamblin, who made it to the finale as pairs.</p><p>The rest of their castmates were sent off to the boardroom to vote for the Perfect Match. Although Joey and Kariselle looked to have it in the bag — they were together from day one and got engaged, after all — they didn’t walk away as the winners.</p><p>After the rest of the cast voted, Dom and Georgia’s love story resonated with everyone more than the rest, and they were ultimately crowned the title of Perfect Match.</p><p>Perfect Match is currently streaming on Netflix.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rrvNrKueqqOWu6Wv0aKropujY7CwuY6trWiqlZa5qsDYZquvZ6Cav6exwq1kppmkmLVurdGeZJygnKSybsLEoqucoF2Wu6V50qGYsqaVYreiutKepWarpJ65rXnTqJ6erJiav3A%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestD - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
