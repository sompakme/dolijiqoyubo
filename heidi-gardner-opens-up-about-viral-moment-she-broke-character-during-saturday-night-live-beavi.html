Not breaking character and refraining from laughing even through the most hilarious of sketches. Cast member Heidi Gardner (who has been on the show since 2017) is normally very, very good at staying in character—that is, until Beavis and Butt-Head came along.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/CuZMLAvjfV3avJcZMtcEWe-1920-80.jpg><p>On last Saturday’s show, Gardner memorably lost it for around 30 seconds in a sketch featuring host <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-auto-tag-linker=true data-before-rewrite-localise=https://www.marieclaire.com/tag/ryan-gosling/>Ryan Gosling</a> as Beavis and fellow cast member Mikey Day as Butt-Head. (For those that might not remember the 1990s, Beavis and Butt-Head was a popular cartoon created by Mike Judge that aired on MTV.) In the moment—which has gone viral—Gardner told <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-url=https://www.vulture.com/article/snl-heidi-gardner-beavis-and-butthead-sketch-interview.html referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-hl-processed=none><u>Vulture</u> </a>that nothing could have prepared her for what she saw when she turned around and saw longtime co-star Day in total Butt-Head cosplay. Gardner told the outlet that she had already “lost it” during dress rehearsal earlier that day: “This makes me feel almost even worse and unprofessional,” Gardner said. “When I looked and saw Mikey in the dress rehearsal, I lost it. I was shocked. I’m thinking about it right now and laughing. I recovered and tried to tell myself in between dress and the live show, ‘You can’t laugh like that again.’”</p><p>Before the live show later that night, “I was trying to imagine seeing him in my head so I was prepared for it, but I just couldn’t prepare for what I saw,” Gardner said. “I really tried. I even saw Mikey out of the corner of my eye seconds before I went live. I saw the red shorts. I knew I couldn’t look over there again. Mikey even told me later that he was bending down and hiding himself so I wouldn’t see him.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ZJSoEU89YEupSWeJV6QZDh-1920-80.jpg><p>In the sketch, Gardner plays NewsNation host Bobbi Moore, who is hosting a town hall on the AI revolution, <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-url=https://ew.com/heidi-gardner-breaking-snl-beavis-and-butt-head-sketch-8634009 referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-hl-processed=none><u>Entertainment Weekly</u> </a>reports. She welcomes an expert professor, played by Kenan Thompson, who is immediately distracted by an audience member—Gosling, sitting behind Garner and bearing a striking resemblance to Beavis, blue shirt and blonde pompadour and all. Later, Day’s Butt-Head makes an appearance, with his gray shirt and exposed gums; when Gardner saw him, she couldn’t “fully face the camera as she continues laugh-gasping,” Entertainment Weekly reports.</p><p>In all fairness to Gardner, only some of the prosthetics were included in the dress rehearsal: “The dress rehearsal was when the prosthetics made their debut—the noses and the mouths,” Gardner said. “I didn’t know about Mikey’s exposed gums and teeth.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Cf2S6QqdrWDmMw8eQbSxYi-1920-80.jpg><p>She also added that during rehearsals they were “still working out the particular blocking” of the sketch, including sorting out how and where to look, so there wasn’t room for it to be as funny as it would become just yet. “I remember thinking, ‘Oh, this is way more technical than I thought,’” Gardner said. “Ryan was already giggling at this point, but yeah, I didn’t get a total sense of what it was going to be,” adding she never got “the sense that this would be a nuclear moment for me.” (Gosling broke character in this sketch and throughout most of the show.)</p><p>During the live show, as she broke character, Gardner said Day subtly egged her on: “Mikey does seem to turn his head just a little bit and bug out his eyes,” she said. “It’s like he’s doing a subtle acknowledgement. That was new…Something in the way he moved on live television felt like when someone messes with you to make you laugh.”</p><p class=newsletter-form__strapline>Marie Claire email subscribers get intel on fashion and beauty trends, hot-off-the-press celebrity news, and more.

I’ll never be able to shake looking over my shoulder and seeing what I saw. That’s really special.”</p><p>As she left the stage and headed back to her dressing room, she wondered “Oh my God, was that okay?” She told Vulture “I had some friends in my dressing room, and they were like, ‘Of course it was okay.’ So many other writers and cast members came up and said, ‘Good job.’”&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/oPjySQaSRS76bCpFaKdx7d-1920-80.jpg><p>Yet we’re all our toughest critic, and Gardner is no exception. “I had coached myself for so many years not to break,” she said, describing herself as a “perpetual people-pleaser rule follower.” She added “It was nice that I broke the rules—unintentionally, of course. I can’t help what I saw, but people were okay with it. Not only okay with it, but encouraged it. That’s all the feedback I’ve gotten since.”</p><p>Click here to <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86qKgK0asGo" referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-hl-processed=none><u>see the skit for yourself</u></a>—but only if you are in the mood to laugh really, really hard.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rq3RopycpJGev6Z6wqikaJuVobKjvsitsGiglZ6xqnnGmqmdppWnerS6y2aZnpmmnsBurtStq2aglZaxbr%2FKnqucoF8%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestD - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
