Overall, fans know that Melly has been incarcerated for almost six whole years. During this time, he has been investigated and put on trial for allegedly killing two of his friends. Although the first go-round was a mistrial, Melly is supposed to be retried. This has subsequently led to all sorts of delays, and no one really knows whether or not there is going to be closure, anytime soon.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Interestingly enough, Melly was name-dropped on <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">Kendrick Lamar's new Drake diss, "Euphoria."</a> “Yeah, Cole and Aubrey know I’m selfish, the crown is heavy/ I pray they my real friends but if not, I’m YNW Melly," Kendrick raps on the song. It's a great bar and it is probably one of the more memorable lines from the track. Having said that, it appears as though Melly was made aware of this name-drop. In fact, he made a statement to TMZ, which makes sense given the fact that Lamar's line is implying a few things.</p><span><h2 class="__className_a6f35b font-bold text-2xl lg:text-[2.125rem] mb-[18px] font-poppins leading-10" id=h-ynw-melly-speaks>YNW Melly Speaks</h2></span><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">“<a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Kendrick Lamar</a> is one of my favorite rappers so I feel honored and appalled … I’m a household name — just for the wrong shit!!!” Melly explained. It is certainly a valid way to feel given how things have shaken out here. That said, Kendrick's bar has renewed discussions around Melly's case and how some feel as though he has been mistreated. Moving forward, only time will tell whether or not Melly's trial get sped up.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Let us know what you think of this response from YNW Melly, in the comments section down below.
