My mum wanted me to. She sent me to an acting coach but she didn't like the way I said my S's," he explained with a laugh. "So I was happy with that. I never really wanted to go down that route."&nbsp;</p><p id=eFfaOvEVlZj data-wc=30>Val had already inherited a love of music from his father's side. His paternal grandfather was the celebrated orchestral violinist, <a class=hm-link href=#>David McCallum Sr</a>, and his grandmother, Dorothy, was a cellist.&nbsp;</p><p id=ehlG_zHVd5G data-wc=87>Coincidentally, David was faced with the same choice as Val in his younger years, but rather than choosing music over acting, he chose acting over music. In an interview with <a class=hm-link href=# rel=nofollow>Radio Times</a>, the NCIS alum recalled: "My father and mother were both musicians. I became an oboe player and my father offered to send me to Paris, to the Conservatoire, and study the oboe. By that time I was hooked on the stage and said, 'No, I'm going to go on the boards.' And I did."</p><a href=# style=text-decoration:none rel="noopener noreferrer">View post on Instagram</a>&nbsp;<p id=e_CoFdAFNGB data-wc=71>Prior to his passing, David shared a sweet bond with his children, and in 2021 Val posted a throwback photo from their time together. "A sweet memory from a few years back. Me and my forever charming always well pressed slightly smaller rascally twin enjoying a nice white wine," Val joked in the caption. "He came out a few minutes before me ... I'm still trying to keep up with him."&nbsp;</p><a href=# style=text-decoration:none rel="noopener noreferrer">View post on Instagram</a>&nbsp;<p id=eCQlmAT5Xq_ data-wc=41>Following the news of David's death last year, Val has since reunited with his father's co-star, Pauley Perrette. Taking to Instagram in October, the actress revealed that she'd watched Val perform alongside Jackson Browne, and praised the duo's "Excellent musicianship."</p><p id=ePUEk9k1wY5 data-wc=32>Fans were naturally touched by the crossover and shared their disbelief at Val's resemblance to David in the comments, grateful that a piece of the star lives on in his talented son.</p><h2 class="newsletterTitleClass_nlzr60o hm-heading">Sign up to HELLO Daily! for the best royal, celebrity and lifestyle coverage</h2><span class=newsletterDisclaimerClass_ncg5smk><p>By entering your details, you are agreeing to HELLO!
