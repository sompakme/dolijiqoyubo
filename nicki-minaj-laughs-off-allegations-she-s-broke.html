"Imagine being this dumb üò©üòÇ. They SOOOOOO mad that they had to eat ALL their words about this tour. ü§™ They tried EVERYTHING to prevent this magic & even blatantly lied everywhere hoping it would deter ppl from coming. If y‚Äôall only knew. Bwahahahahahaaa," Minaj wrote on X. The rapper was responding to resurgent claims that her Pink Friday 2 tour was not profitable and was only being done to cover her debts.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">However, randos on social media are not the only people who have had to eat crow over the tour. DJ Akademiks' plan to prove Minaj was "washed" backfired when the controversial social media creator discovered live on stream that the rapper's Pink Friday 2 tour was genuinely sold out. Akademiks, a <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">longtime critic</a> of Minaj, had jumped online to "prove" that the claims of Minaj's tour sales were overblown. However, try as he might, he was unable to any of her tour dates that had more than a few tickets still available. Minaj continues her tour tonight (March 10) with a show in Seattle.</p><span><h2 class="__className_a6f35b font-bold text-2xl lg:text-[2.125rem] mb-[18px] font-poppins leading-10" id=h-barbz-already-demanding-tour-film-from-nicki-minaj>Barbz Already Demanding Tour Film From Nicki Minaj</h2></span><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Meanwhile, despite Minaj being just three shows into her tour, the Barbz are demanding a "cinematic experience" like <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">Taylor Swift</a> and <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">Beyonce</a> produced last year. "I hope there will be movie experience of this tour! üòç visuals are top tier and @NICKIMINAJ looks amazing üíñ," one popular fan account on X wrote. As mentioned, Minaj has only hit up Oakland, Denver, and Las Vegas so far on the 57-stop tour. The tour runs until July 14, when Minaj will close out with a performance at the Les Ardentes Festival in Belgium.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Furthermore, the tour includes Minaj headlining Wireless Fest in London, a performance she is very excited about. "Instead of doing another arena show in London after we sold out in the first week, I opted to do Wireless Festival. This year's show will be a billion times more special, creative, beautiful, cohesive, ugh! I'm so excited. I'd like to tell you guys thank you in advance. Last year was so meaningful but won't compare. Just wait & see," Minaj wrote on Instagram. Minaj has been a regular feature at Wireless for over a decade.</p><p>About The Author</p><p>Benjamin Mock (they/them) is a sports and culture writer working out of Philadelphia.
