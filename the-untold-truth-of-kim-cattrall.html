Since Christopher's death, Kim has been open about how difficult it's been to process such a gigantic loss while living in the public eye. "I'm still in a state after losing my younger brother Chris to suicide last year," she told The Guardian in 2019. "He was only 55 and the shock of his death was so extreme that I can't fill that void. It's made me more aware of how fragile we all are. It can happen to any of us."</p><p>Since his death, Kim has often paid tribute to her younger sibling on social media by sharing photos of them together. In January 2022, she marked what would have been Christopher's 59th birthday with an emotional <a href=#>Instagram</a>&nbsp;post, which she captioned,&nbsp;"Happy Birthday, sweet 'Topher'. We miss you today and every day. RIP x #suicideprevention."&nbsp;</p><p>While processing her grief, Kim has also been candid about how Christopher's death would have impacted her late dad, telling <a href=#>The Times</a>,&nbsp;"I'm just glad my father wasn't alive to experience it. As tough as he was, I don't think he could have taken it."</p><p>If you or anyone you know is having suicidal thoughts, please call the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline​ by dialing 988 or by calling 1-800-273-TALK (8255)​.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmamthZYN0gI6upa2nnJl6tb7UrZ9mo5mieqSt06uYpaRf</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestD - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
