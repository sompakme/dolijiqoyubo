It was just part of my life. I grew up in a loud Italian household. I still had a normal childhood - three girls fighting, laughing and telling jokes. [Arena has an older sister, Nancy, and a younger sister, Silvana.]</p><p>A lot of commitments had to be made so I could be on TV every week.<br>Mum and Dad were busy taking me to rehearsals, so Nancy had a lot of responsibility to care for Silvana at an early age.</p><p>After YTT, I moved to LA.<br>That journey was important - I grew up and learnt a lot. I liked that no one there knew anything about me.</p><p>My second album, Don't Ask, catapulted me to a different level of fame [in the '90s].<br>Young Talent Time didn't have a great deal of credibility, so when the accolades started rolling in, I thought, what's happening?</p><p>Of course, there are periods when you wish you weren't in the music industry.<br>There are always low times in life, but they're necessary in order to live. I consider myself very fortunate to still have creative freedom.</p><p>I met Vincent [Mancini, Arena's partner] in London in 2000.<br>I was doing Notre-Dame de Paris in the West End and still living in the US, so there was a lot of commuting to Europe. I think we'll marry one day - I never say never.</p><p>Becoming a mum changed me for the better.<br>[Arena and Mancini have a son, Gabriel, 6.] That little bundle of joy is the best gift in life.</p><p>Motherhood puts everything into perspective.<br>Living in Paris feels natural. When your partner is French and your child was born there, it makes sense to spend part of your life there.</p><p>Being awarded the French National Order of Merit was surreal.<br>The evening was beautiful - not because of the recognition, but because I was surrounded by friends and family.</p><p>I couldn't think of any reason not to participate in the new Young Talent Time.<br>[Arena is a judge on the show, which airs 7pm Fridays on Network Ten.] If there's anyone who can speak from experience, it's me. I was lucky to have great support when I was on the show. I don't think anyone could do it without that, particularly a child.</p><p>I've realised what I do makes me happy, and it makes other people happy, too.<br>It's rare to continue to love your work. There are still things I want to do, but I'm a great believer in fate; I'll let it do whatever it needs to.</p><p>--</p><p>Catch Tina Arena live in Sydney in June and in Melbourne from July.
