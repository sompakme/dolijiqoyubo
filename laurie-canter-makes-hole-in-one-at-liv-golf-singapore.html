I just missed it a little, so I was sort of screaming at it to stay in the air. And, yeah, I mean, when I watched it back, I couldn't believe how far it pitched on the green. So, I mean, yeah, I guess it's not the best shot I hit all day, but obviously delighted with the result."</p><p>He went on to add: "We couldn't see it go in because the..., it was just the way the light was on the green at the time. So kind of saw it bounce and heard like a sort of murmur that it was going to be a half-decent shot. And then everyone up at the green went mental at it. Yeah, we just had a bit of a laugh. Yeah, once we realized it went in we went nuts. First one in a tournament."</p><p>The ace is the third in LIV Golf history, with Matt Wolff making one back in 2022, and Chase <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-auto-tag-linker=true data-before-rewrite-localise=https://www.golfmonthly.com/tag/brooks-koepka>Koepka</a> making one in Adelaide just last week.
