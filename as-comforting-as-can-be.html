Even hapless student vet Richard (James Anthony-Rose) came good, despite “all his farm knowledge coming from Old McDonald and Mother Goose”.</p><p>This was an episode about home, about belonging, about the family you find rather than the one you’re born into. It was also a throwback to simpler times. Feelings were left stoically unsaid and upper lips were stiffened yet the truth was written all over the character’s faces. Siegfried admonished Gerald about his duty of care towards his dog, when he was clearly talking about Mrs Hall.</p><p>Her surrogate mother-and-daughter relationship with Helen was tenderly portrayed. “I’ll put t’ kettle on,” was the cure for all ills. Warm and soothing, All Creatures Great and Small is the televisual equivalent of a cuddle and a cuppa. We left on a cosy scene as Siegfried, Helen and Mrs Hall played board games by the fireside. “Best of three?” asked eternal bad loser Siegfried and truly it was. The trio were so terrific, James and the already absent Tristan were hardly missed.</p><p>No wonder this nostalgic and life-affirming drama is Channel 5’s biggest show. It’s blissful escapism with an unexpectedly emotional undertow. Roll on the Christmas special, when we’re promised an heroic homecoming and a new arrival. What could be more festive? I’ll put t’ kettle on.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbHLnp6rmaCde6S7ja6iaKymZH9xfpJoaGpnYG58orjLZpqrnZGpwrOx0maeq52RqXqiusNmqqaZnKF6p7XNmqOeZaKaw6qx1mg%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestD - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
