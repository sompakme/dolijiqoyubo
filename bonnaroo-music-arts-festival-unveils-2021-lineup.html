Bonnaroo will once again present an extraordinarily diverse bill featuring a remarkable selection of top artists performing around the clock across more than 10 unique stages over the four-day festival.</p><p>Hailed by the New York Times as the summer event that “revolutionized the modern rock festival,” Bonnaroo has drawn high profile media attention and critical acclaim for two groundbreaking decades.&nbsp;</p><p>The complete Bonnaroo 2021 lineup&nbsp;is below.</p><p>Tickets for Bonnaroo will go on sale today, March 31 at 1 PM ET/12 PM CT, via <a href=#>www.bonnaroo.com/tickets</a>.

Bonnaroo organizers as always will be in regular communication with local health and public safety officials and will continue to abide by relevant recommendations. As it approaches, Bonnaroovians will receive regular updates with the important information needed to plan their trip to The Farm, including any changes to policies and procedures they’ll need to know before entering the festival and campgrounds.&nbsp; Updates will be shared at <a href=#>www.bonnaroo.com</a>, through Bonnaroo’s social media channels, and via the Bonnaroo email list (sign up <a href=#>HERE</a>).</p><p>“It’s exciting to see Tennessee stages come back to life in time to celebrate the 20th anniversary of this internationally acclaimed festival,” said Gov. Bill Lee. “Fans are ready to gather together and celebrate their shared love of music once again. We welcome them back for a full Bonnaroo and what is sure to be a truly unforgettable event!”</p><p style=text-align:center># # #</p><p><strong>BONNAROO 2021 – NEW AND IMPROVED</strong></p><p>Bonnaroo has continuously paid close attention to fan feedback in order to best enhance their onsite experience, each year incorporating additional features and exciting upgrades to the overall event. 2021 will be no different, with new activities and site improvements, including better signage, wayfinding help, pedicabs, info booths, cooling stations, and more.</p><p><strong>INTRODUCING: JAMTRAK:</strong><br>Bonnaroo has made getting around the festival easier and more convenient than ever before.

All set up and ready to go upon arrival, each tent comes with a choice of cot or inflatable bed, electric cooling unit, a souvenir blanket for each ticket holder, and more. This year will also see the introduction of Bonnaroo Daily Entry Camping Passes, a new system required for all vehicles and campers that will drastically cut wait times entering the festival site. GA ticket-buyers will be required to secure a vehicle pass by day for either Tuesday, Wednesday, or weekend access from Thursday through Sunday.&nbsp; The earlier campers arrive, the closer they will camp in proximity to Centeroo.
