Not only because they find Hollywood denizens sharing rarified air and sipping Moet, but because they ask us to forget about the world’s troubles. For a few hours, we enjoy <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>gourmet eye candy</a>, stan our favorite <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2>constellations of stars</a>, and scroll social feeds stacked with hot takes. But this year’s Golden Globes felt even more surreal than most, given the spread of woes that demand our attention once the glitter settles.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Many who took the stage expressed concern and support for people affected by fires sweeping across Australia, while a number of winners voiced calls to civic action. “While I love my kids so much, I beg of us all to give them a better world,” said <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>Patricia Arquette</a>, accepting her supporting actress award for Hulu’s <i>The Act</i>. “For our kids and their kids, we have to vote in 2020.” Accepting best actress for <i>Fosse/Verdon, </i><a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>Michelle Williams</a>,<i> </i>who recently revealed <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=3>she’s engaged and expecting</a> her second child, spoke passionately about women’s right to choose.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_5-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Of course, the best Hollywood entertainment often grapples with the anxieties and tensions that characterize our everyday lives. Directly or indirectly, stories on the small and big screens compel us to see and think about the world differently — even when most of what we see may be pretty dark. From drama series based on true events to movies that seek emotional and empirical truths, these Golden Globe nominees and winners speak to the here and now. Plus, they’re already available to stream.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-the-farewell></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_7-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>The Farewell</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_8-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Awkwafina made history as the first-ever Asian-American woman to win for Best Actress in a Comedy or Musical. Best known as a breakout comic genius in <i>Crazy Rich Asians</i> and <i>Ocean’s 8</i>, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Awkwafina is a total revelation</a> in her first major dramatic role. Though the Golden Globes classified <i>The Farewell</i> as a comedy, it’s a bit more complicated than that. Filmmaker Lulu Wang <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>based the story on her own family’s decision</a> to keep a terminal cancer diagnosis from her ailing grandmother. It’s a tender, sad, and often hilarious meditation on the burdens and blessings of love and loss. Yes, this film will wring out your heart — but it’ll fill it back up to the brim, too.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_10-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Stream it on <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>Amazon Prime Video.</a></p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-ramy></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_14-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Ramy</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_15-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Hulu</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_16-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The night’s first winner, Ramy Youssef for Best Actor in a Comedy Series, came as a total surprise. Even Youssef joked that most people in the crowd and at home probably hadn’t seen his Hulu series. <i>Ramy</i> is a funny and complex portrait of a young Muslim guy living with his conservative immigrant parents in New Jersey. Given that American TV has mostly cast Muslim characters as criminals and security threats, <i>Ramy</i> is something of a balm — full of the messy, hilarious humanity too long absent from how our popular imagination often considers Muslim people.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_18-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Stream it on <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>Hulu.</a></p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-the-morning-show></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_20-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>The Morning Show</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_21-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Apple TV</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_22-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">When you’re not in the mood for actual news, Apple’s fictionalized take on a New York morning show offers an uncanny look behind the cameras. <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Jennifer Aniston</a> and <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>Reese Witherspoon</a> were both nominated for their roles as co-anchors of a show that resembles <i>Today</i>, in a story inspired by the ousting of Matt Lauer. The series picks up steam throughout the first season, with Aniston in particular showing a side of her talent not often seen. A second season has just been announced, so you have plenty of time to catch up (though you’ll probably blaze right through it in one weekend).</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_24-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Stream it on <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>Apple TV+.</a></p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-chernobyl></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_26-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Chernobyl</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_27-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>HBO</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_28-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The devastating consequences of human folly on the natural world seem to be everywhere we turn. HBO’s <i>Chernobyl</i>, which won Best Miniseries, is a bracing and gripping account of the 1986 nuclear disaster with eerie and inescapable echoes in the present. If there were ever a historical catastrophe that stands as proof we’re screwing up the planet, Chernobyl is it. Cringe at the egoism and incompetence that led us to the brink of apocalypse, and take heart at the front-line heroism and commitment to the truth it inspired.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_30-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Stream it on <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>HBO Go.</a></p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-the-report></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_32-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>The Report</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_33-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Alamy</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_34-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The early-2000s government misconduct exhumed in <i>The Report</i> has suddenly grown in resonance since the movie’s relatively low-key fall release. Led by <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Adam Driver</a> and Annette Bening (nominated for her performance as Senator Dianne Feinstein), <i>The Report </i>follows Senate investigations into the CIA’s torture of suspected terrorists in the wake of 9/11. Another case of facing painful history to resist seeing it repeated, this movie somehow feels both too soon and perhaps not soon enough.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_36-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Stream it on <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>Amazon Prime Video</a>.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-unbelievable></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_38-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Unbelievable</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_39-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Netflix</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_40-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">A number of winners, most notably women, used their platform to speak about pressing cultural issues from a deeply personal point of view. That’s the spirit of Netflix’s acclaimed miniseries <i>Unbelievable</i>, based on the true story of a rape survivor who was charged with filing a false report. Years later, two women detectives work to uncover the truth of her claims. It’s an incisive and illuminating look at whose voices are heard and believed, and a first-rate example of a series that addresses an urgent and sensitive subject with care and insight.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_42-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Stream it on <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Netflix.</a></p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-booksmart></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_46-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Booksmart</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_47-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>MGM/Shutterstock</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_48-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">If and when it all feels like too much to bear, an escape to simpler (and younger and raunchier) times is certainly in order. Beanie Feldstein was nominated for her performance as a high school senior who realizes she’s been so busy being good at school that she forgot to have fun. Slapstick and super-sweet chaos ensues, with Kaitlyn Dever by her side playing the equally driven and somewhat less ready to rebel best friend. With <i>Booksmart</i>, Olivia Wilde has made the kind of teen movie that we’ll be cueing up on repeat with the ranks of <i>Lady Bird</i> and <i>Mean Girls</i>. Invite your ride-or-die and press play for an unforgettable night of forgetting your cares.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_50-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Stream it on <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>Hulu.</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK570Z6top2nqHqku9WeqZqflWS0sLjDnqVmn5ykr6Z5kWlpaWWepLqqusSeqmarpKeyormMp6aw</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestD - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
