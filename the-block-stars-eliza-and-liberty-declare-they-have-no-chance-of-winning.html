They’re such hustlers. But yeah, I mean they actually really deserve it because they hustle. We just don’t.”</p><p>In terms of relations between the teams, which was frosty in the final weeks of the show, Eliza said everything had been “mature” and “amicable” as the cast reunited this week for filming.</p><p>“We wouldn’t be mad [if the others won],” Eliza said. “Can I just say, I’ve turned over a new leaf. I can’t give anything away but there’s been a moment.</p><p>“I just decided that I was going to try and let my walls down and be open to the experience. And I’m really going to look at this all now, very positively. And I really, genuinely be happy for everyone get some money.”</p><p>Meanwhile, the show’s judges – Shaynna Blaze, Darren Palmer and Marty Fox – each divulged on their winning predictions in an interview with <a class=body-link href=#>nine.com.au</a> – and they all agreed Steph and Gian’s House 4 would be hard to beat.</p><p>“As we know the best doesn’t always win, but I would be shocked if House 4 does not win,” Blaze said.</p><h4 class=g_font-title-xxs>More Coverage</h4><p>“The quality, the sense of calm and architectural attention to detail shows Steph and Gian have created the ultimate luxury and it truly makes it one of the best houses on <i>The Block</i>.”</p><p>Palmer added, “With dollars per square metre ratio as your metric, you can assume that House 4 will sell for more. That may also mean they have a higher reserve which then may not mean they sell for the highest profit … but we will only find out reserves on auction night.”</p><p><i>The Block finale airs Sunday at 7pm on Channel 9</i></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7HWrGWcp51jrrZ7xKernqqklravucSnq2ispmS%2Fpq3LoquyZaSrfLW0xGaZpaeToHq0wMCrqmadnJ7HonnAp5tmpJmXsrPA2Gabnpuclr%2BmedOhnLJlmJbDpnnNqGScoJGjsKZ5zp9ksKGeo7avs46nnLCrXajBsL7YaG%2BfmZNng6WDwXJscp6Va4R0hJdxZ52dlZaxpYPAm2ec</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestD - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
