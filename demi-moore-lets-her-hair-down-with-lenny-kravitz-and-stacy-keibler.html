The glam brunette was clearly enjoying herself as she bopped away with the likes of singer&nbsp;<a class=hm-link href=#>Lenny Kravitz</a> and <span><strong>Stacy Keibler</strong></span>. Demi, who recently <a class=hm-link href=#>celebrated her 50th birthday</a> in Dubai and India, seemed to be getting on like a house on fire with Lenny at the bash, sitting down and chatting away with him while still having a boogie to the music.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/3ce39bed4020-demi-moore-z.jpg><p id=ePmPktm0Jm_k data-wc=241>The actress, who showed off her endless legs in a grey jumpsuit and towering heels, played up for photographers, pulling her hair across her face and posing for the cameras. She was also snapped with <a class=hm-link href=#>George Clooney</a>'s statuesque girlfriend Stacy, who was on chic form in a patterned satin dress. And she was pictured catching up with Rupert Murdoch's pretty wife Wendi. One photo snappers didn't manage to capture was a shot of the G star with her new beau, <a class=hm-link href=#>Vito Schnabel</a>, who was at the party. The pair were careful not to be pictured together, but onlookers said they cosied up together away from the glare of the cameras. Demi is said to have clicked with the 26-year-old art dealer at the spectacular 50th birthday party Naomi Campbell threw for her boyfriend Vladimir Doronin in India last month. A source told the New York Post the couple were getting cosy on the dance floor. Since then, the new couple have been "quietly spending time together", according to the paper. Vito, the son of artist Julian Schnabel, is no stranger to dating A-List ladies who are older than him. He was romantically linked to 49-year-old Elle Macpherson. In 2010, he also dated actress Liv Tyler, who is nine years older. Vito's 60-year-old father is also proof that age doesn't matter when it comes to affairs of the heart, having just announced his engagement to 30-year-old former model May Andersen.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/ee0e7b04e531-demi-moore-1-z.jpg><p id=eqYl3ke6gWEn data-wc=130>Demi seems in a much better place recently, after inicially being hard hit by the end of her marriage to <a class=hm-link href=#>Ashton Kutcher</a>. The actress split with the star after six years of marriage last November amidst reports he had been unfaithful. "As a woman, a mother and a wife, there are certain values and vows that I hold sacred, and it is in this spirit that I have chosen to move forward with my life," she said at the time announcing the split with "great sadness and a &nbsp;heavy heart".She has also had to cope with seeing her ex move on, starting up a new romance with his old friend Mila Kunis. Ashton has known Mila, his co-star from , for 14 years.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbHLpaammZeWx6q6xGeaqKVfmLKtscGroK2hlah8c3yQa2hraGZmfXSClmibnqWZYrqwu9GeZKWdnqPGbrfRmq2irKpk</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestD - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
