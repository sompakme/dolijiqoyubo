In the official images released this week, we can see how the shoe is covered in a light blue nubuck aesthetic that certainly brings some great colors together. Overall, the shoe has a nice Winter feel to it, and the silver 3M tongue remains a selling point that will get potential consumers lining up for a pair.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">As it stands, this new shoe will be dropping on October 7th of this year for a price of $190 USD.
