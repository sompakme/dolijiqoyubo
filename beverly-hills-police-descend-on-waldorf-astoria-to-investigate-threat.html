A steady stream of sirens could be heard from miles away as both the Waldorf Astoria and the adjacent Beverly Hilton hotels were put under lockdown with help from officers in West Hollywood and Los Angeles. The situation unfolded as a wave of music industry and press insiders were due in the area for credentialing ahead of Clive Davis’ A-list pre-Grammy party, scheduled to take place on Saturday at the Beverly Hilton.</p><h3 id=title-of-a-story class="c-title lrv-u-margin-b-075">Related Stories</h3><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">At 9:39 a.m., BHPD responded to a call at the hotel from staff security regarding a disturbance from a male guest who was believed to be armed. Before BHPD officers arrived, security had knocked on the door and heard someone on the other side yell, “I’m going to shoot through the door!” Once officers arrived on the scene, they employed the use of a drone to discover the suspect with a firearm while standing on the hotel balcony. BHPD called in the help of SWAT personnel, crisis negotiators and mutual aid from surrounding authorities.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><p lang=en dir=ltr>BHPD detained a suspect & will remain on scene to investigate.

He complied “and was safely taken into custody,” per a statement from BHPD. Joseph Leonardi, a 41-year-old man from Woodland Hills, was charged with possession of a firearm as a convicted felon and negligent discharge of a firearm.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">A rep for the Waldorf Astoria confirmed that “an isolated incident” occurred there today, adding “the hotel is cooperating fully with local authorities. The wellbeing, safety and security of our guests and team members are of paramount importance.
