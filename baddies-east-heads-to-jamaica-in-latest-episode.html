In a previous for the next episode of Zeus' Baddies East, Natalie Nunn announced that the group is headed to Jamaica. After weeks of infighting and betrayal, all appears to be going well. However, all of that appears to go downhill as the alcohol starts flowing. The preview shows several members of the team being loaded into wheelchairs as well as what appears to be a confrontation with security at a local venue.</p><p>However, not everyone was hyped by the preview. "Ain‚Äôt sh-t finna happen this episode fr they gone drag it till next week," one person complained. "Smiley lied abt her miscarriage, she lied about the seizure, she lied abt her play in you getting jumped lmao at some point say you just simply don‚Äôt like her and go üò≠," added another. "Wasn‚Äôt Rollie the main one taking about Smiley fighting Mariah because she‚Äôs tiny. Now she‚Äôs fighting Mariah. üíÜüèæ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èü§¶üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è," noted a third. Despite this, fans will have to tune into Sunday's episode to see what really goes down in Jamaica.</p><p><strong>Read More: <a href=# rel>Baddies East: Natalie Nunn's Times Square Trip Goes Awry</a></strong></p><span><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-fans-start-petition-to-get-rollie-off-baddies-east>Fans Start Petition To Get Rollie Off Baddies East</h2></span><p>However, the show's drama isn't only limited to the weekly episodes. A fan petition has emerged online, demanding the removal of cast member Rollie Pollie. Rollie is a divisive figure, known for her no-holds-barred attitude during physical confrontations with other cast members. At the time of writing, the Change.org petition has been signed over 80,000. With nearly 55,000 signatures on January 6 alone, it's likely that fans were spurred by the latest episode trailer.</p><p>An earlier petition, that only received around 400 signatures, gave some fan reasoning as to why Rollie should be removed. The petition creator accuses Rollie of "consistently engaging in bullying behavior and acting with an air of superiority that is damaging to the community spirit." The Zeus Network, on which Baddies airs, is yet to address the now-viral petition.</p><p><strong>Read More: <a href=# rel>Nicki Minaj Questions Who Rollie From Baddies Is On IG</a></strong></p><p>[<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">via</a>]</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvTp5ywoJmltbC8jZympmdnan16f5RmmZqclJ6ytHnEmqqtZZqWuqK1wpo%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestD - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
