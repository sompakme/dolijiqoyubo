However, it is normally preferable to apply it before a light rain or, if no rain is anticipated, you may water it in gently to ensure it is well absorbed.</p><p></p><h3>In addition, is Scotts Triple Action a pet-friendly product?</h3><p>Pets are welcome on lawns that have been treated with Scotts. The Scotts Miracle-Gro firm manufactures a wide range of popular fertiliser products, including the Turf Builder series of lawn fertilisers, which are particularly popular in the United States.

Often, it is advisable to take a conservative approach to your investment. This necessitates fertilisation two days before to the arrival of rain. The Southwest Florida Water Management District estimates that a 36-hour window is required between fertilisation and rainfall.</p><p></p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-150 data-inserter-version=2></span><span class="ezoic-ad ezoic-at-0 large-leaderboard-2 large-leaderboard-2150 adtester-container adtester-container-150" data-ez-name=ncertpoint_com-large-leaderboard-2><span id=div-gpt-ad-ncertpoint_com-large-leaderboard-2-0 ezaw=300 ezah=250 class="ezoic-ad ezads-sticky-intradiv ezoic-adl"></span></span><span data-nosnippet class=reportline data-ez-ph-owner-id=150><span class=ezoicwhat><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/go.ezodn.com/utilcave_com/ezoicbwa.png alt=Ezoic title=ezoic name="?pageview_id=c1b0d497-7c2c-4916-5edc-f0c7de6750f2&ad_position_id=150&impression_group_id=ncertpoint_com-large-leaderboard-2/2023-12-26/2534470515158279&ad_size=300x250&domain_id=230869&url=https://www.ncertpoint.com/2021/12/is-scotts-turf-builder-triple-action-safe-for-dogs.html" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></span></span><h3>What is the average time it takes for granular fertiliser to disintegrate?</h3><p>In less than two weeks, it was gone.

After that, you should wait at least 24 hours before allowing children to play on the grass.</p><p></p><h3>Is it possible for lawn fertiliser to harm my dog?</h3><p>Fertilizers Nitrogen may even cause your dog’s paw pads to get burned. Some fertiliser producers provide products that are “safe” for dogs, according to the company. Even such items, however, may include substances that are harmful to your dog’s health. Alternatively, you may skip the fertiliser and just keep your dog off the fertilised grass for at least 24 hours.</p><p></p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-152 data-inserter-version=2></span><span class="ezoic-ad ezoic-at-0 large-mobile-banner-1 large-mobile-banner-1152 adtester-container adtester-container-152" data-ez-name=ncertpoint_com-large-mobile-banner-1><span id=div-gpt-ad-ncertpoint_com-large-mobile-banner-1-0 ezaw=250 ezah=250 class="ezoic-ad ezads-sticky-intradiv ezoic-adl"></span></span><span data-nosnippet class=reportline data-ez-ph-owner-id=152><span class=ezoicwhat><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/go.ezodn.com/utilcave_com/ezoicbwa.png alt=Ezoic title=ezoic name="?pageview_id=c1b0d497-7c2c-4916-5edc-f0c7de6750f2&ad_position_id=152&impression_group_id=ncertpoint_com-large-mobile-banner-1/2023-12-26/1761552893157242&ad_size=250x250&domain_id=230869&url=https://www.ncertpoint.com/2021/12/is-scotts-turf-builder-triple-action-safe-for-dogs.html" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></span></span><h3>Is it possible for dogs to get ill after consuming fertiliser?</h3><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-long_content"></span><p>The intake of fertiliser by dogs may result in a wide range of various signs and symptoms.
