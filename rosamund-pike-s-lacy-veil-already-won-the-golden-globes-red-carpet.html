This year, she's up for one award, Supporting Actress in a Motion Picture, for her role of Elspeth Catton in&nbsp;Saltburn&nbsp;— a role that's eclipsed anything and everything&nbsp;Gone Girl&nbsp;thanks to the character's eccentricity and the film's viral moments (check TikTok if you don't believe us).</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Pike's intricate veil was the perfect complement to her lacy Dior Haute Couture dress, which included a strapless silhouette paired with a Swiss dot overlay that added more floral embellishment on her shoulders and arms.

There’s something about our obsessions — whether it’s with celebrity or with sports stars or whatever — that she’s transposed and set amongst the English upper classes, but it’s the same thing. It’s the thing that we can’t have that we love and loathe in equal measure, the way that people feast on Instagram over lifestyles that they can’t have and are envious of and want in the in the same breath."<br></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK570aiqmqWlo7FuvMiknGZqYGeBbrPOpZuepl2cubCuxKxkq52UYrCivs%2Beq2aulZ65boSTa2psaGk%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestD - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
