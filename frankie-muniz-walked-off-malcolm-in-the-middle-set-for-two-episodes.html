I walked off the set,” Muniz said during an appearance on Australia’s I’m a Celebrity … Get Me Out of Here, shared by <a rel=nofollow href=#>News.com.au</a>.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">“Everyone was so afraid to stand up when certain people were controlling or rude or disrespectful,” he continued. “They walked on pins and needles.”</p><h3 id=title-of-a-story class="c-title lrv-u-margin-b-075">Related Stories</h3><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">Muniz clarified that it wasn’t necessarily him specifically experiencing the tension, but that he was “so mortified by seeing people afraid to stand up for themselves” that “it was worth it to me.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">“I didn’t care if they told me I was never going back,” he added, also ceding that he was able to make such a move given his status as the series protagonist.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">Muniz starred in Malcolm in the Middle for its seven-season run from 2000 to 2006, when he was a teenager. Since then, he has mostly left acting in pursuit of a <a href=# id=auto-tag_nascar data-tag=nascar>NASCAR</a> career, but <a href=#>recently reflected</a> on his experience as a child actor on TikTok.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">“I would never let my kid go into the business,” Muniz said. “And not that I had a negative experience, because to be honest, my experience was 100 percent positive. But I know so many people, friends that were close to me, that had such insanely negative experiences.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">Muniz and wife Paige Price, whose son Mauz is 3, both are familiar with the television and media business.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">“I just think it’s an ugly world in general,” he added. “I never cared about rejection, but there’s a ton of rejection.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">Nevertheless, Muniz still holds fondness for his Malcolm family. In 2022, <a href=#>he said</a> he would love to revisit the show.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">“I know Bryan Cranston is really into the idea,” he said at the time. “There might be something. I would be down 100 percent.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvLpbCwp5%2BZv6a8zqurnqpemLyue9OvZq2uXaOyuL%2BOn6mappuesm651Kegs2WnlrmsscNmpp%2BeXaKura%2FOpaRmoZ5iwamxjKagnZycmnq0sdNmaGtrZW2DdX6SbGY%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestD - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
