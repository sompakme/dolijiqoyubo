Those little jewels of tart and sweet perfection. Picture yourself, strolling through your garden, plucking a handful of these ruby wonders straight off the bush. Sounds delightful, doesn't it? But hold on there, sunshine-seeker! If you live in the sizzling south Texas climate, you might need to replace that mental picture with a mariachi band playing a mournful tune for your fallen raspberry dreams.</p><h3 data-sourcepos=5:1-5:56>The Great Raspberry Debacle: Can They or Can't They?</h3><p data-sourcepos=7:1-7:251>Traditionally, growing raspberries in south Texas has been about as successful as wearing a fur coat in July. The brutal heat, the relentless sun – it's enough to make even the most resilient raspberry bush wilt faster than a politician in a scandal.</p><p data-sourcepos=9:1-9:372>But fear not, fellow fruit fanatics! There's a glimmer of hope on the horizon. <strong>Texas A&M AgriLife</strong>, those brave souls on the frontlines of horticultural warfare, have been experimenting with shade and – get this – there have been <strong>survivors!</strong> Apparently, some raspberry varieties, with a little TLC (and maybe a sombrero), can tolerate the south Texas inferno.</p><p data-sourcepos=11:1-11:263><strong>However, a word to the wise:</strong> Don't expect a bumper crop that'll rival Willy Wonka's chocolate factory. You might get a few tasty berries, but it'll likely be a more intimate affair, like a one-on-one raspberry tea party for you and a very grateful squirrel.</p><h3 data-sourcepos=13:1-13:54>So You Want to Tango with a Texas Raspberry Bush?</h3><p data-sourcepos=15:1-15:94>If you're feeling adventurous (or just really love raspberries), here's what you need to know:</p><ul data-sourcepos=17:1-21:0><li data-sourcepos=17:1-17:167><strong>Pick your partner wisely:</strong> Not all raspberry varieties are created equal. Look for heat-tolerant options like the ever-so-slightly-regal-sounding <strong>Dormanred</strong>.</li><li data-sourcepos=18:1-18:248><strong>Location, location, location:</strong> Shade is your new best friend. Plant your raspberry throne in a spot with morning sun and afternoon shade. You might even consider a shade cloth canopy – think of it as your raspberry's personal beach umbrella.</li><li data-sourcepos=19:1-19:167><strong>Water, water, everywhere:</strong> Keep that soil consistently moist, but not soggy. Imagine yourself as a hummingbird with a watering can, flitting from bush to bush.</li><li data-sourcepos=20:1-21:0><strong>Mulch it up:</strong> A good layer of mulch will help retain moisture and keep the roots cool. Think of it as a luxurious spa treatment for your thirsty raspberry.</li></ul><p data-sourcepos=22:1-22:187><strong>Remember:</strong> Growing raspberries in south Texas is a bit like training a poodle to herd sheep – it's not impossible, but it'll definitely raise some eyebrows (and maybe a few chuckles).</p><p data-sourcepos=24:1-24:287><strong>The verdict?</strong> It's totally doable, but be prepared for a challenge. If you manage to coax a few berries out of your south Texas raspberry patch, consider yourself a horticultural champion. Just don't forget to share your victory (and maybe a recipe) with your fellow brave gardeners!</p>0898240430153153567<p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvWrGWtnZOdfHN8kW1maWxfmK6vedGaqqmalae%2FqrHSZp6rp6ditq950qisraBdqbK5rdJnn62lnA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestD - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
