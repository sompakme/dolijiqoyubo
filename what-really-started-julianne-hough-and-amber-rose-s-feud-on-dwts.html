During an episode of the&nbsp;<a href=#>"Loveline" podcast</a>,&nbsp;Rose revealed that Hough's comments felt like body shaming. "It was a point in the dance where I had to lift my leg up and Maks dipped me and [Julianne] said, 'Oh, I'm uncomfortable,' and I instantly, I felt, I did feel body-shamed," said Rose (via <a href=#>Us Weekly</a>). Rose also referenced the other pro dancers and contestants who dressed in revealing costumes and engaged in sultry dances. "They look absolutely stunning and they get a standing ovation," said Rose. "And for me, and my body, my hips, my a**, my breasts, made her uncomfortable," added the former model.</p><p>Furthermore, Rose addressed Julianne Hough directly the following week on "Dancing With The Stars." After Rose and Maksim Chmerkovskiy completed their Argentine Tango, host Tom Bergeron opened up the floor for Rose to repeat her comments on the spot. "Like I said in the package, I just, you know ... when you said that I felt very embarrassed, I felt that you weren't talking about my dance," <a href=#>said</a> Rose. "But if I misunderstood, then I apologize." Rose then explained that she wanted things to be positive between them going forward.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmamxhZX92hI6wn5qsXajBor7TnptmoqWhtqK6zZ5koaelnLVurcybnKtloqTApnnFnqydZZSWu6S1zaBksKGknXq1tMRmqq2Zoqh8</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestD - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
