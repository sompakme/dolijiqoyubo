It’s encouraging that there are still players out there who want to play for the club and have a feeling for the club.</p><p>“I don’t think that does him any harm either. It will benefit the self-esteem of the supporters, the owners and the players that this football club is still held in high esteem.</p><p>“That should be a great signal for everybody to drive forward and make their own history.”</p><p>Suárez, who insists he has signed for “the most famous club in England”, will add passion, desire and leadership to Liverpool according to the Ajax managing director, Rik van den Boog.</p><p>“Luis is going to bring the place alive because he is a street fighter,” Van den Boog said. “He arrived here with a decent reputation, but he was not a big player then. But in the dressing room he soon stood up and became a leader. That’s why he was special.</p><p>“Also, when he goes on his travels to South America he always rushes back. He is back on the training pitch the next morning when he has just flown around half the world for a game for Uruguay.</p><p>“But we’ll remember him for his incredible amount of goals and what he has done for the club. Our fans were crazy about him.”</p><p>His return of 13 goals in 38 games for Uruguay is outshone by his 81 in 110 appearances for Ajax and, pending the successful processing of international clearance, Suárez will make his Liverpool debut against Stoke at Anfield tonight.</p><p>Dalglish said: “We have known about him for three years. When I came back here, it was early on that we were looking at him, so when we were talking about players it was pushing at an open door regarding Suárez.</p><p>“He’ll be a fantastic player and we’re all looking forward to seeing him play. You go on YouTube and you get seven minutes of goals. That’s not a bad hit.</p><p>“He’s fantastic in the dressing room, that’s why he was captain of Ajax. For a Uruguayan, and a forward at that, to be captain of Ajax tells you something about the personality of the fella.”</p><p><b>How Kenny's No 7 shirt has been far from lucky</b></p><p><b>Vladimir Smicer</b> Signed to replace Steve McManaman in 1999, Smicer took the No7 jersey and was beset by injuries and poor form.
