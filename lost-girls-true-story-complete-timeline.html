If that's the case, Netflix's gripping new true crime movie Lost Girls may just fit the bill.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=1 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The scripted film chronicles the true story of the disappearance of Shannan Gilbert, a 24-year-old sex worker in upstate New York, and her mother Mari Gilbert's relentless search for justice. Faced with apathy from the local police department, Mari sets out to piece together Shannan's final hours and uncovers a series of unsolved murders of sex workers in Long Island and the surrounding area. Lost Girls is based on <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.amazon.com/Lost-Girls-Unsolved-American-Mystery/dp/0062183656 data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Robert Kolker's book of the same name" class="body-link css-1xesb7e emevuu60">Robert Kolker's book of the same name</a>, and while the film stays relatively close to the truth, the real story of the Gilbert family is, if anything, even more extraordinary and tragic than what's depicted on-screen.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=2 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Below, a timeline of the true events behind Lost Girls and the still-unsolved mystery of the Long Island serial killer.</p><h2 data-node-id=5 class="body-h2 css-1ooignj emevuu60">May 1, 2010</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=6 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">At <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.cbsnews.com/news/48-hours-uncovers-missing-escort-shannan-gilberts-final-minutes/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="4:51 a.m." class="body-link css-1xesb7e emevuu60">4:51 a.m.</a>, 911 operators received a frantic call from Shannan, who was visiting a client in Oak Beach, Long Island—an upscale gated community. Shannan was screaming, "They're trying to kill me," <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=http://pix11.com/2016/07/25/shannan-gilberts-sister-heard-voices-drowned-a-puppy-in-months-before-her-mothers-murder/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="according to PIX 11" class="body-link css-1xesb7e emevuu60">according to PIX 11</a>, as dispatchers tried to determine her location. A neighbor reported seeing her running away from the client's home toward a swampy area, but by the time police arrived shortly after 6 a.m., Shannan had disappeared. She was never seen alive again.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=7 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The man Shannan had visited prior to her disappearance was Joseph Brewer, a first-time client.

Brewer stated in a deposition that Shannan became "inexplicably unhinged" during the evening, and that he had enlisted her driver, Michael Pak, to come and pick her up. After placing the 911 call, per Rolling Stone, she reportedly fled from both Brewer and Pak, which is when the neighbors saw her and alerted the police.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=8 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Richard Dormer, then the Suffolk County police commissioner, told <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/4wbegj/ghosts-of-suffolk-county-inside-the-bizarre-unsolved-case-of-the-long-island-serial-killer data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=Vice class="body-link css-1xesb7e emevuu60">Vice</a> that after running from Brewer's house, Shannan rang the doorbell of an elderly man, Gus Coletti, who called the police.

In a press conference in February of 2016, the family's attorney, John Ray, stated that a report noted there was no indication Shannan had died by drowning, as police had reportedly suspected.

"This was a worsening situation," Ray explained. "It grew steadily more acute in the last year, that she had this schizophrenic mental state. ... She was on medications, and so often the case with mentally disturbed people, they don’t take their meds. And she didn’t take her meds, and you can see the consequences of it." He also noted that he believed Shannan's disappearance and murder had had an "adverse effect" on Sarra's mental state.</p><h2 data-node-id=34 class="body-h2 css-1ooignj emevuu60">August 3, 2017</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=35 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Sarra was convicted of Mari's murder and sentenced to 25 years in prison, which is the maximum allowed by law in the state of New York.

Hart stated without elaborating that the department believed that the belt had been handled by the murder suspect. The belt is not a newly discovered piece of evidence, but was being released to the public for the first time.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=38 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Hart also reiterated that Shannan's death is not believed to be linked to the other deaths, because she "doesn't match the pattern of the Gilgo Beach homicides." She urged the public to come forward with any information relating to the murders or the belt, and when asked why she was releasing the image now after so long, she noted vaguely that "now is the time to release this information."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=39 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The Suffolk County Police Department also set up the website <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.gilgonews.com/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=gilgonews.com class="body-link css-1xesb7e emevuu60">gilgonews.com</a> to share updates on the case and collect tips from the public.
