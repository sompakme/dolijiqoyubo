It came when she met fellow actor Michael McKean after <a href=#>her divorce</a> from actor Bill Geisslinger, with whom she shares two daughters. O'Toole and McKean told <a href=#>Theater Mania</a> that they were acquaintances before becoming friends. Their love story started while they were working together on the 1998 movie "<a href=#>Final Justice</a>." They first struck up a friendship, then McKean eventually worked up the nerve to tell O'Toole that he had feelings for her.</p><p dir=ltr>Ahead of their first date, they went shopping for shoes for McKean, who recalled that he was looking for the box with his old shoes inside them when an employee told him, "I gave them to your wife [referring to O'Toole]." O'Toole overheard, and when they left the store, McKean said that she told him, "In case you were wondering, the answer is yes." And this was all before the main event of their first date:&nbsp;a concert featuring Bob Dylan, Joni Mitchell, and Van Morrison.</p><p dir=ltr>By the time Morrison closed the concert, the couple knew that they were meant to be together. "I would've married him that day," said O'Toole. She explained that the fact that they both had kids slowed their courtship down, but they made it to the altar in 1999.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmb2xlZ4F4e9OhnGaqlZa5brjIn5xmqJGnwa%2Bx0axkqJ5dqbWmecKaqq1ln5t6t7XRoKCnZaKew6a%2Bjg%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestD - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
