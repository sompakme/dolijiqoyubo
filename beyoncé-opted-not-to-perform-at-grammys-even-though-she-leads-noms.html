Much of today's (March 12) conversation about the Grammys centered around <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>The Weeknd</a>, <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Justin Bieber</a>, and Beyoncé. We've heavily reported on&nbsp;<a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">The Weeknd's shocking snub</a> this year and we also learned that&nbsp;<a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">Bieber may not attend the ceremony</a> because his album, Changes, wasn't included in the R&B categories. Throughout the day, Beyoncé has been trending on social media following the Los Angeles Times's interview with British television producer Ben Winston who has taken the helm of this year's show.</p><p>Gareth Cattermole / Staff / Getty Images</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">During their chat, it was noted that Beyoncé, who is leading with nine nominations this year, won't be performing. It reportedly makes for the third time in the show's history that the artist with the<a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color"> most nominations</a> won't be taking to the stage, and Winston was questioned about fans' reactions when they learn that Bey "opted not to perform."</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">“It’s unfortunate, because she’s <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">such a big part </a>of the Recording Academy. We absolutely wish we had her onstage," said Winston. He also shared a story of another artist—who he didn't name—being asked to perform this year but they ultimately turned it down because they were still upset about years prior. It's a strange place for Winston to be in because he's in charge of making sure the show goes on without a hitch, not who is nominated or wins.</p><p>Frederick M. Brown / Stringer / Getty Images</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">“You know that’s the deal when you take over the show," said Winston. He spoke with music executives and labels about “what they thought about the Grammys.” When speaking with the unnamed artist, "She was like, ‘I got snubbed three years ago, and I’m still annoyed about it.’ I told her, ‘Right, but you know that’s nothing to do with me?’ She said, ‘I don’t know — it sort of is, isn’t it?’”</p><p>About The Author</p><p>Erika Marie is a seasoned journalist, editor, and ghostwriter who works predominantly in the fields of music, spirituality, mental health advocacy, and social activism.
