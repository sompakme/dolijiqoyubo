Warner certainly feels some attachment to his former team who is&nbsp;picking first overall tonight at the NFL draft.

This creates a bit of a conflict since the Cardinals drafted QB Josh Rosen with their first-round pick last season.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg"><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener" class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">Warner spoke to TMZ</a>&nbsp;about this scenario and gave some advice to Rosen who is probably feeling a little anxious tonight.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">"Bottom line is it's just part of it," Warner said&nbsp;"You gotta go and just prove you're the best guy for the job."</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Warner also went on to say that Rosen can't be mad at the Cardinals for wanting to take a player if the team thinks he'll make them better. The Super Bowl-winning QB was complimentary of Rosen and how he's handled everything so far.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">"I don't think you can ever be offended by a team trying to figure out the best thing for their organization to get better. And your job is to compete," Warner explained.&nbsp;"He's going to get an opportunity to play somewhere. Just be ready for that opportunity and continue to shine."</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Who do you think the Cardinals should pick tonight?</p><p>About The Author</p><p>Alexander Cole is the current Managing Editor of HotNewHipHop.
