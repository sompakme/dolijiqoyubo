"When Michael was diagnosed with cancer I really thought, 'You are going to have to wipe me off the floor,'" she told <a href=#>The Telegraph</a>, admitting that she'd never experienced a health scare so close to home. "This happens to people all the time, but it's still a huge shock when the cards start to fall and you realize, "My God, it really is happening to us."'</p><p>As she recalled, Douglas kept his spirits up throughout chemotherapy and radiation therapy, but Zeta-Jones had to be hospitalized over her mental health during the stressful period. "When you get sideswiped like that, it's an obvious trigger for your balance to be a little bit off â€” not sleeping, worry, stress. It's a classic trigger," she explained.&nbsp;</p><p>Eventually, the actor was diagnosed with bipolar disorder. In an interview with <a href=#>Good Housekeeping</a>, she shared that&nbsp;knowing more about the condition had been valuable. "There are amazing highs and very low lows. My goal is to be consistently in the middle," she said.</p><p>If you or someone you know needs help with mental health, please contact the <a href=#>Crisis Text Line</a> by texting HOME to 741741, call the <a href=#>National Alliance on Mental Illness</a> helpline at 1-800-950-NAMI (6264), or visit the <a href=#>National Institute of Mental Health website</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmamlhZX9zgI6ipayhlJp6pK3ToZyroZ6aerux05pko6eemsBuuMifnGaZnpl6pK3RnpyrZaSdv7DBxqFkraCVYsamrdGsZg%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestD - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
