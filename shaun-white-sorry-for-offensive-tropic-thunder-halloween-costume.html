It has since been taken down and a&nbsp;mea culpa has gone up.</p><p>“I owe everyone in the Special Olympics community an apology for my poor choice of Halloween costume the other night,” White said in a <a href=# rel=nofollow>statement</a>. “It was a last-minute decision. It was the wrong one. The Special Olympics were right to call me on it.”</p><p>Soeren Palumbo, co-founder of Special Olympics’ Spread the Word to End the Word campaign, told Huffington Post in a <a href=# rel=nofollow>statement</a> the organization was “truly disappointed” in the professional snowboarder.</p><p>“We are truly disappointed that Shaun White, an acclaimed Olympian, would choose this costume which is so offensive and causes so much pain. Disability is not a joke nor should it be a punchline. We hope that Shaun White and others learn that this just continues stigma, stereotypes and discrimination.”</p><p>In&nbsp;Tropic Thunder, Simple Jack was an over-the-top mentally handicapped character, played by Ben Stiller’s fading star, Tugg Speedman, to mock obvious Oscar-bait films involving someone with disabilities.&nbsp;</p><p>The character was condemned by a number of groups in 2008.&nbsp;</p><p>Stiller on Tuesday afternoon commented on the news after a Twitter user made a snarky remark.&nbsp;</p><p>“Actually, Tropic Thunder was boycotted 10 years ago when it came out, and I apologized then. It was always meant to make fun of actors trying to do anything to win awards. I stand by my apology, the movie, Shaun White, And the great people and work of the @SpecialOlympics,” he <a href=# rel=nofollow>said</a> via Twitter.&nbsp;</p><p dir=ltr lang=en>Shaun White is facing backlash for dressing up as Simple Jack, an intellectually disabled character from Tropic Thunder, for Halloween.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>Shaun White is facing backlash for dressing up as Simple Jack, an intellectually disabled character from Tropic Thunder, for Halloween. <a href=# rel=nofollow>https://t.co/zmFWa78RHy</a> <a href=# rel=nofollow>pic.twitter.com/pDuysba4vz</a></p><p>— E!
