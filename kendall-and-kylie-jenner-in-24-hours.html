I like getting up early and feeling really productive before lunch. The first thing I do is check my phone. Instagram is my favorite app. I don't post too often, but sometimes I'll go through my albums and find some really good throwbacks. <strong data-redactor-tag=strong data-verified=redactor>7:00 A.M. </strong>I prefer to work out in the morning. To stay toned, I do a lot of ab work with my trainer, Gunnar Peterson, and occasionally I'll take a kickboxing class. <strong data-redactor-tag=strong data-verified=redactor>8:00 A.M.</strong> Where I head first varies from day to day, depending on if I'm on set or working on our new contemporary line, Kendall + Kylie. I like driving, but usually I'll take a car. I always have to be DJ in the car. I'm obsessed with making playlists. When you make a playlist, you have to know the crowd and fit the right vibe, as well as throw in a few classics and newer stuff that nobody's heard. I listen to Kanye [West], Drake, and Justin [Bieber] a lot, but I don't have a favorite genre of music. If it's a good song, it's good. <strong data-redactor-tag=strong data-verified=redactor>9:00 A.M</strong>. We start our day meeting with our Kendall + Kylie team in the office. The collection is extra special because it represents how Kylie and I dress today. We'll review fabrics, have fittings with models, and meet photographers to collaborate with on our upcoming look-book shoots. <strong data-redactor-tag=strong data-verified=redactor>12:00 P.M</strong>. Most of the time lunch is really quick. I typically eat lean chicken and brown rice, and am always snacking on raw veggies with dip and hummus. I wish I had more time to do grocery shopping because I like picking out my own vegetables.&nbsp;</p><img alt="Interaction, Black hair, Paper, Paper product, Romance, Love, Publication, Reading, Stock photography, Flesh, " title="Interaction, Black hair, Paper, Paper product, Romance, Love, Publication, Reading, Stock photography, Flesh, " width=638 height=1007 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hbz.h-cdn.co/assets/16/06/1455229224-hbz-24-hours-with-kendall-kylie-01.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><a rel=noopener href=# class="pinterest css-esp0ot e1c1bym14"><img data-dynamic-svg=true src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.harpersbazaar.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/social/pinterest.e8cf655.svg?primary=%2523ffffff" data-testid=dynamic-svg-base height=auto width=auto alt=pinterest style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=6 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><strong data-redactor-tag=strong data-verified=redactor>2:00 P.M.</strong> On a typical day, I can have four or five meetings and appointments back-to-back. Right now we're developing "our girl." Kylie and I are a really good creative team. She's not afraid to speak her mind, and she has really good ideas. My favorite pieces in the collection are the jumpsuits because they're really huge for spring and the sets we did in matching fabrics.<strong data-redactor-tag=strong data-verified=redactor> 4:00 P.M.</strong> There's no set end time for when I'm off the clock. Some days I'll be on set until night; others, I'll leave the office for an interview, then head to an event or have to travel. It's a very fast-paced schedule. To relax, a massage is always nice, but I'll mostly get caught up on sleep or lounge at home with my sisters. I'm also obsessed with frozen yogurt. I could eat it every day, but I aim for twice a week to treat myself. I usually get the classic Tart flavor from Go Greek.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=10 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><strong data-redactor-tag=strong data-verified=redactor>6:00 P.M.</strong> If I'm lucky, dinner is a normal time, like 6 P.M. In L.A., I love Nobu for sushi or Craig's, where I order the vegan spaghetti Bolognese or Margherita pizza. I always make sure to have one or two nights a week out with friends, where I'll get dressed up for dinner and be social. I think part of staying inspired and happy really comes from surrounding yourself with the right energy. Thankfully I have friends who lift me up and help push me. We're all going through these changes in our careers together. <strong data-redactor-tag=strong data-verified=redactor>11:00 P.M.</strong> I have to sleep at least seven to eight hours to be fully awake for the next day, so I try to get to bed as soon as I can. I've trained myself to fall asleep anywhere possible, in the car or on a flight.</p><img alt="Photograph, Dress, One-piece garment, Day dress, Snapshot, Waist, Long hair, Cocktail dress, Fashion design, Vintage clothing, " title="Photograph, Dress, One-piece garment, Day dress, Snapshot, Waist, Long hair, Cocktail dress, Fashion design, Vintage clothing, " width=1278 height=1007 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hbz.h-cdn.co/assets/16/06/1455229059-hbz-24-hours-with-kendall-kylie-03.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><a rel=noopener href=# class="pinterest css-esp0ot e1c1bym14"><img data-dynamic-svg=true src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.harpersbazaar.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/social/pinterest.e8cf655.svg?primary=%2523ffffff" data-testid=dynamic-svg-base height=auto width=auto alt=pinterest style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=14 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><strong data-redactor-tag=strong data-verified=redactor>KYLIE</strong>&nbsp;</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=16 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><strong data-redactor-tag=strong data-verified=redactor>7:00 A.M.</strong> I like to bounce out of bed. I can't just stay there and hang out. The first thing I do is check my phone and Instagram. I look at my friends' accounts—I think they honestly all have good pictures. <strong data-redactor-tag=strong data-verified=redactor>7:15 A.M.</strong> I like to look cute if I'm heading to work on the collection because it inspires me. I love doing my own makeup. I like Charlotte Tilbury Light Wonder Foundation and Giorgio Armani Face Fabric Makeup, because it's superthin. I always use Nars concealer and Laura Mercier translucent powder. I like Charlotte Tilbury bronzer and blush and Anastasia Beverly Hills eyebrow pencil. Then my Kylie Lip Kit is the only thing I wear. It takes me only 10 minutes to get everything done. <strong data-redactor-tag=strong data-verified=redactor>7:30 A.M.</strong> I can get ready really fast. I'm always the first one ready out of all of my friends. For a no-brainer outfit, I'll put on a plain long-sleeved bodysuit, which I have in a bunch of different colors, and jeans. I'm more into sneakers than heels right now—I have maybe 50 pairs. The most comfortable are by APL.&nbsp;</p><img alt="Product, Brown, Wood, Hardwood, Flooring, Sandal, Black, Wood flooring, High heels, Beige, " title="Product, Brown, Wood, Hardwood, Flooring, Sandal, Black, Wood flooring, High heels, Beige, " width=1276 height=1005 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hbz.h-cdn.co/assets/16/06/1455228889-hbz-24-hours-with-kendall-kylie-05.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><a rel=noopener href=# class="pinterest css-esp0ot e1c1bym14"><img data-dynamic-svg=true src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.harpersbazaar.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/social/pinterest.e8cf655.svg?primary=%2523ffffff" data-testid=dynamic-svg-base height=auto width=auto alt=pinterest style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=20 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><strong data-redactor-tag=strong data-verified=redactor>8:00 A.M. </strong>I've never been a breakfast person. If I do eat breakfast, it's at home, and it's not healthy at all. I just don't like granola or cereal or anything like that, so I'll do hash browns or bacon or banana pancakes. <strong data-redactor-tag=strong data-verified=redactor>10:00 A.M.</strong> When we get to the studio to work on the collection, what we do first depends on how far along we are. If we're working on fittings, we'll have all the clothes ready and have models to try them on so we can make sure that everything looks exactly as we want it to. We're always seen on the red carpet all glammed up, but people don't really get to see our casual styles, so we wanted to do a line that reflects what we wear on a day-to-day basis. We've been working on this collection for a long time, and I'm so excited that it's finally coming out.&nbsp;</p><img alt="Shoulder, Photograph, Standing, Waist, Trunk, Beige, Flash photography, Snapshot, Chest, One-piece garment, " title="Shoulder, Photograph, Standing, Waist, Trunk, Beige, Flash photography, Snapshot, Chest, One-piece garment, " width=1282 height=1008 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hbz.h-cdn.co/assets/16/06/1455229299-hbz-24-hours-with-kendall-kylie-04.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><a rel=noopener href=# class="pinterest css-esp0ot e1c1bym14"><img data-dynamic-svg=true src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.harpersbazaar.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/social/pinterest.e8cf655.svg?primary=%2523ffffff" data-testid=dynamic-svg-base height=auto width=auto alt=pinterest style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=24 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><strong data-redactor-tag=strong data-verified=redactor>12:00 P.M.</strong> We have lunch in the office because it's hard to go out. We always have paparazzi following us, especially when it's Kendall and me together. We love Joan's on Third. We both order the Chinese chicken salad. <strong data-redactor-tag=strong data-verified=redactor>2:30 P.M.</strong> In the afternoon, we go off and do our own things, and I'll see my friends. We like to go outside and explore the world and just be kids. Yesterday we were outside all day walking around my mom's neighborhood, and then we hung out with her all night. I love hanging out with my family. Living on my own now, I feel more independent, but we all have such a close bond. <strong data-redactor-tag=strong data-verified=redactor>4:00 P.M.</strong> I've been getting back into working out. I stopped for Christmas and New Year's, so I have to get back into it. I work out with [my sister] Kourtney and her trainer, who is also Kanye's trainer. We work out for an hour. It's hard, but it makes me feel good. Kourtney likes to blast music. I'm really into Kanye's new songs. PartyNextDoor has a song called "Party at 8," which my friends and I have been listening to on repeat.</p><img alt="Photograph, Hand, Black hair, Wrist, Snapshot, Photography, Long hair, Paper, Flesh, Stock photography, " title="Photograph, Hand, Black hair, Wrist, Snapshot, Photography, Long hair, Paper, Flesh, Stock photography, " width=635 height=996 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hbz.h-cdn.co/assets/16/06/1455229097-hbz-24-hours-with-kendall-kylie-02.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><a rel=noopener href=# class="pinterest css-esp0ot e1c1bym14"><img data-dynamic-svg=true src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.harpersbazaar.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/social/pinterest.e8cf655.svg?primary=%2523ffffff" data-testid=dynamic-svg-base height=auto width=auto alt=pinterest style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=28 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><strong data-redactor-tag=strong data-verified=redactor>6:00 P.M. </strong>I love cooking these days. I like to make burgers. I also make spaghetti because my mom is obsessed with spaghetti. It's the first thing I learned to cook. I love potatoes; I'll make all different kinds of potatoes, like scalloped potatoes, mashed potatoes, candied yams. <strong data-redactor-tag=strong data-verified=redactor>8:00 P.M.</strong> Most of the time I prefer a night in with my friends. We typically watch movies and just hang out. I love Mean Girls. It was a big part of my childhood, and I watched it a lot when I was younger, so I think that's why I love it. <strong data-redactor-tag=strong data-verified=redactor>12:00 A.M.</strong> I've been going to bed around midnight lately. Before bed I use Neutrogena wipes to take off my makeup. I also use coconut oil on my hair and body. You just rub it on your hands so it melts, then rub it all over your body, or wherever you want. I think it was Jaden [Smith] who told me about it.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qa3RqZyrq5KWx6Kt0WeaqKVfmMKtwNSrnGielZbBtr7ErGaaaWRlgXN7y6KdnmWfm3qssc2dmKWkXaDGrbXEZqGepp6av258kmptaA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestD - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
