He took the stage as a surprise, where he performed his&nbsp;DUMMY BOY hit, “BEBE.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/urbanlinx.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/userfiles/68/87/438768_dc5170caadb98ffd586c7f57ceaa200a.jpeg><p><h6>John Parra/Getty Images</h6></p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">While Ak’s clip shows the crowd feeling the show, several Twitter users have reported that the New Yorker was boo’d by the crowd. “6ix9ine is at Miami Bash and holy f*ck he’s so bad I have second hand embarrassment,” one person wrote. “[People] are walking out and using him as a bathroom break.”</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">“The crowd booing 6ix9ine when he got off the stage at Miami Bash,” someone else added.
