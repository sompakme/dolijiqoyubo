While at Vimeo, Sanchez led efforts to take the video platform public and to a global user base of over 300 million viewers.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">She also spent over a decade at HBO, where she held leadership roles in business intelligence and audience insights. Those skills will be available to Tubi as, like rival streamers, its business model hinges on data-driven analysis as it relies on a tech platform and content algorithms to reach and retain viewers.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">“It’s a pivotal time in the entertainment business as the streaming landscape shifts increasingly towards ad supported models. Tubi’s leading ad tech, unique and growing audience and vast content library makes for a truly differentiated offering for advertisers, content creators and viewers,” Sanchez said in her own statement.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">Tubi said it reaches one in four households in the U.S. market, as measured by VideoAmp from July to September 2023. The Fox-owned streaming service faces competition in the U.S. market from Paramount’s Pluto TV.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">The growth at Tubi comes as the AVOD platform has expanded its content offerings to more than 200,000 movies and TV episodes and close to 250 FAST Channels. The platform has also produced or acquired close to 200 Tubi Originals, which it says have been watched by nearly 54 million viewers.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">The Originals include a Black Noir cinema&nbsp;slate, produced under Village Roadshow Pictures and Content Cartel in association with Fox Entertainment Studios.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvLpbCwp5%2BZv6a8zqurnqpemLyue8GuqqKmlajAcK7UrKCnnaOoeq%2Bx1qxmra2Snnqku9Srq6edqWLAorrCoZyzZZOdtqayjKyrq5mkmrS6ec6fnaKblad6cn6Sbm5yaWBsgXA%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestD - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
