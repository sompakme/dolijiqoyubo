It was the day their first baby boy, Mason, was born. Five years later, it was the day that their second son Reign was born, too. "I still can't believe they have the same birthday," the Kardashian wrote on <a href=#>Instagram</a>, and we can't believe it either.</p><p dir=ltr>Funny enough, Mason's due date was actually Christmas Eve, according to <a href=#>E!</a>. However, their first son was born 10 days early, and Reign's due date, unfortunately, ended up being around the same time, too.</p><p>When Kardashian and Disick originally found out they were expecting another baby in December, they were set on making sure she didn't give birth to him on Mason's birthday. "I really tried to not have it happen, so they could each have their day, but there was no way around it," she later admitted in a blog post (via <a href=#>Us Weekly</a>). Yet, their youngest baby had a birth plan of his own. "It is truly so special and meant to be," she added.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmbnBmZYN3e9OhnGasoqrBqXnAm6aurF2gvLa%2B06ecsmWblr%2BlrdKhoJqmXZa7pXnSnKatrF2ZtrS1wqSqZpuYnrmlvsSnZg%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestD - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
