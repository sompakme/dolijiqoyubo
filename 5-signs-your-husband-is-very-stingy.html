You find yourself bending backwards&nbsp;to accommodate someone new into your life&nbsp;and you won't mind because you love them.</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/vllkyt185auihbp3i8.jpg><p>It's good when love takes over and you accept someone good into your life but sometimes you ignore the bad habits because of love. This could be because you hope the situation will improve in marriage or because the love is still blinding you.</p><p>Marriage has a way of waking you up from the blindness of love and revealing the deepest secrets people have. So one day you may wake up and find that the 'cute' things your husband does are actually very bad habits of a stingy person.</p><p>If you do find out he is stingy, find ways to help him be more giving or seek couples therapy to discuss his problems and bring him closer to change.</p><p>If you are still blinded by love and want to be sure, here are five signs of a stingy husband&nbsp;that you need to know.</p><p><strong>1. He relates things down to money</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/vllkyt4lca6fhkc6a.jpg><p>You talk to him about different&nbsp;things in your life but he always seems to conclude the conversation with money. It's about how you could have earned money in the day or how the person you are talking&nbsp;about could have saved money.</p><p><strong>WANT MORE?</strong> Download the Naij Weddings App today and get fast updates</p><p>He will&nbsp;also come to you with different money-making schemes and you will lose track of them. So you will end up hearing how much money he could be making or how you can be a part of the plan.</p><p><strong>2.&nbsp;Mentioning buying something new is like a taboo</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/vllkyt420tpohooi6.jpg><p>When you mention you want something new, it is like world war three to him. He cannot understand what is wrong with your old clothes, shoes and old things.</p><p>He loves old things and sees no reason to spend me expensive things. So if you are a lady who likes fashion or shopping, you end up saving your own money or window shopping in silence.</p><p><strong>3. He tries to fix things plenty times before agreeing to buy a new one</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/vllkyt7m1nrgcu8c8.jpg><p>It could be something very cheap&nbsp;but if it is fixable, he will offer to buy parts first before&nbsp;a new one. You will tell him getting a new one is better in the long run but he only judges it from the option which involves him parting with the least money.</p><p>So you end up managing things that are already on their last legs. It will be door handles, furniture, phones and even cars. You will be suffering while he is there thinking of the fortune he has saved.</p><p>R<strong>EAD ALSO:</strong>&nbsp;Read how this woman’s walking step made her man propose (photos)</p><p><strong>4.&nbsp;When you need emergency money, you dread asking him</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/vllkyt30seap3coo8.jpg><p>Different things will happen and you may need to break the bank to solve it.
