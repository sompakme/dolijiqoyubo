He is cast as a thief and the main male protagonist who later becomes the love interest of Princess Rapunzel, another favourite Disney character. While the film doesn't reveal much about his identity, one specific detail has always sparked curiosity among fansâ€“his age.

Moreover, he is a cunning and incredibly skilled thief who steals a valuable tiara from the Kingdom's treasures. He proceeds to take sanctuary in a secluded tower which happens to be Rapunzel's home.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/99792146d46b6b06.png></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>All the Despicable Me movies in order and where to watch them</span></p></a><h2>How old is Flynn Rider in Tangled?</h2><p class=align-left>Throughout the movie, Flynn is reluctantly drawn into Rapunzel's quest to realize her goal of seeing the flying lanterns that appear in the Kingdom's skies on <a href=#>her birthdays.</a></p><p class=align-left>Although Flynn Rider's age isn't stated explicitly in <i>Tangled,</i> his demeanour and portrayal gives viewers a hint about his age.</p><p class=align-left>Going by his general outlook, it is reasonable to assume he is anywhere between his late 20s and early 30s. This assessment also aligns with how Eugene is later portrayed as mature, responsible, and caring.</p><h3>How old is Eugene in Tangled according to the creators?</h3><p class=align-left>Eugene's age isn't mentioned in the movie. However, after its release in 2010, the creators spoke about Flynn Rider's age on multiple occasions. The consensus was that Flynn was in his twenties.</p><p class=align-left>Two writers mentioned the number 22. However, the narrative didn't stop there because the movie's sequel, <i>Tangled: The Series</i> (an <a id=https://www.legit.ng/ask-legit/tv-shows-movies/1536050-50-funny-cartoon-characters-definitely-lift-spirits/ href=#>animated TV show</a>), added another layer of detail to his backstory.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/2ba53aacea2bb18e.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>10 Elliot Page movies and TV shows to watch after reading Pageboy</span></p></a><p class=align-left>The series is set after the events in <i>Tangled</i>, and in the final episode of season two, it is revealed that Eugene is the son of King Edmund and his mum was the late Queen.</p><p class=align-left>Doing the math, his mother died 25 years earlier when he was just a new-born baby, and Flynn is confirmed to be at least 25 years old in that episode. This begs the question, how old was Flynn Rider when the movie premiered in 2010?</p><p class=align-left>The events of the animated series reportedly took place two or three years after <i>Tangled</i>. Given that he was first portrayed as a thief who mastered his craft, he must have been 22 or 23 years, just as the franchise creators had alluded to earlier.</p><h3>Is Flynn Rider 26 years old?</h3><p class=align-left>Although there is no actual confirmation as to how old Flynn Rider is in <i>Tangled,</i> the creators, once more, <a href=#>can</a> help fans do the math and ascertain his age.

Unlike Rapunzel, who celebrated her 18th <a href=#>birthday</a> during the movie, it is apparent that Flynn doesn't experience age change.</p><p class=align-left>Furthermore, the movie's events take place within a few months, and it is hardly possible that Flynn Rider's age could've increased by a year or so.</p><p class=align-left>However, it is in the animated series <i>Tangled: The Series</i> (later renamed <i>Rapunzel's Tangled Adventure</i>) and <i>Tangled Ever After</i> (the follow-up to <i>Tangled</i> that was released in 2012) that it can be confirmed that Flynn got to 26 years, and probably surpassed that age.</p><p class=align-left>Having been revealed to be 25 years old in the final episode of season two, the events of the series' third (and final) season meant that he had grown a year older, and was 26 years old, if not older.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/ab6c26ec3726531d.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Does Gerard Butler have a wife?

However, you can base it on<i> Tangled</i>'s specific timelines and references and subsequent installments to estimate his age in human years.</p><p class=align-left>From <i>Tangled</i>, released in 2010, you can establish that Flynn Rider must have been anywhere between 22 to 23 years old.

Based on his demeanour, outlook, and lived experiences as a cunning thief, it is generally believed that Flynn Rider is in his twenties. His life as a thief was unsustainable, and he may have had a lot of maturing to do.
