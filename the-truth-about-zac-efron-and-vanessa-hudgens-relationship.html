She said, "I think it looks hot," acknowledging that "the girls like it." She claimed she was not bothered by his female fans, insisting, "I mean, I like to scream along, too."&nbsp;But in 2010,&nbsp;she told&nbsp;<a href=#>Glamour</a> she "used to" have "moments of jealousy"&nbsp;in their relationship.</p><p>Hudgens was even more honest in a 2015&nbsp;<a href=#>New York Times</a>&nbsp;interview, five years after her split from Efron. She confessed, "I went through a phase when I was really mean because I was so fed up." She admitted, "Girls were running after him, and I was giving them death stares." With time, her perspective changed and she revealed that she reminded herself, "Spread the love, be a good person, they support you, be nice."</p><p>In that 2007&nbsp;Rolling Stone&nbsp;interview, Efron was asked about the silver band he was wearing on his ring finger. He teased,&nbsp;"This is just a ring from a friend that I got. 'Commitment' is way too weird a word for me right now." Of course, people assumed it was from Hudgens, especially since he admitted a "female friend"&nbsp;got it for him.</p><p>Hudgens brushed off the marriage speculation during a 2009&nbsp;People&nbsp;interview, sharing, "I think [marriage and starting a family] is great, but I'm so focused on my career right now that it doesn't really cross my mind."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmbGhiaIN2e9OhnGasoqrBqXnAm6aurF2vrqR5xJ%2BpqKZdlruledWapZ6ro5Z6qcHDoJynq12nsq2t06Kmp6uYnr1w</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestD - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
