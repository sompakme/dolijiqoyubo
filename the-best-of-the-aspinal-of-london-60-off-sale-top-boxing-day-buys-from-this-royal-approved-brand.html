Established in 2001 by British entrepreneur Iain Burton, Aspinal of London has become a British heritage brand with a regal royal following. In fact, it's not just Princess Kate who wears the bags on repeat, Zara Tindall is also a loyal shopper. Kate's sister, the ever so stylish Pippa Middleton, has also been photographed wearing some of their designs.&nbsp;</p><h2 dir=ltr>The bag highlights from the Aspinal of London sale</h2><p id=emeFZ3-J2k-D data-wc=32>If you want to shop Princess Kate's exact bag, you’re in luck.

Our loyal readers love Princess Kate and what she wears, and I love to share the best deals on the <a class=hm-link href=#>brands that Kate wears often</a>. Sadly, I don't own an Aspinal of London bag but I have tested out a sample of the Midi Mayfair bag to see why Kate loves it so much.I would say the <strong>pros&nbsp;</strong>of buying a Midi Mayfair include style (it's aesthetically pleasing), functionality (the detachable chain strap is a bonus), structure (it will keep its shape for years to come) and the fact that it's royal approved. The <strong>cons&nbsp;</strong>would be that the clasp might take a while to get used to. Overall, it's a solid purchase, but one that is made much sweeter with a deduction. Would I buy the bag? Yes, I definitely would. But I'd wear it with the chain strap out (unlike Kate who tends to wear it without the strap), as I think it makes it look trendier.&nbsp;</p><h2 dir=ltr>The bags I'd by in the Aspinal of London sale</h2><li class=affiliateProductListItem_a15uc6c7><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/ca9d4fe73e1a-aspinal-camera-a-bag.jpg><p><h3 class="affiliateProductName_afobsy4 hm-heading">Camera 'A' Bag By Aspinal Of London</h3></p><p class=affiliateProductListTitle_a1a518yz>Editor's Note</p><p>Nothing is more exciting than a new bag, and this red one is uber luxurious.&nbsp;</p><p>Aspinal's Camera 'A' Bag is a stylish option for everyday wear - and Zara Tindall loves her one.&nbsp;</p><p>Handcrafted from the finest full-grain leather in a choice of signature finishes, this compact and lightweight crossbody bag will be one you reach for time and time again.&nbsp;</p><br></li><li class=affiliateProductListItem_a15uc6c7><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/fe2a4ebe06c5-aspinal-regent-tote.jpg><p><h3 class="affiliateProductName_afobsy4 hm-heading">Regent Tote By Aspinal Of London</h3></p><p class=affiliateProductListTitle_a1a518yz>Editor's Note</p><p>Say hello to your work-to-weekend must-have.&nbsp;</p><p>Handcrafted from the finest full-grain leather, the semi-structured and lightweight tote bag design has a spacious interior with the capacity to hold a lightweight 14-inch laptop.<br></p></li><li class=affiliateProductListItem_a15uc6c7><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/8ce0c1365cfd-aspinal-lottie-bag.jpg><p><h3 class="affiliateProductName_afobsy4 hm-heading">Lottie Bag By Aspinal Of London</h3></p><p class=affiliateProductListTitle_a1a518yz>Editor's Note</p><p>I love anything glitzy so I would probably choose this sparkly silver bag.&nbsp;</p><p>The Lottie bag in silver is a timelessly stylish piece designed to take you from day to night.</p></li><li class=affiliateProductListItem_a15uc6c7><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/0e210911efee-aspinal-portobello-bag.jpg><p><h3 class="affiliateProductName_afobsy4 hm-heading">Portobello Bag By Aspinal Of London</h3></p><p class=affiliateProductListTitle_a1a518yz>Editor's Note</p><p>I love how this can be personalised with initials on the shield tab closure.</p><p>The ideal saddle bag, handcrafted from full-grain leather and secured by the brand's signature letterbox closure.&nbsp;</p></li><li class=affiliateProductListItem_a15uc6c7><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/aec942cdb2d3-aspinal-paris-bag.jpg><p><h3 class="affiliateProductName_afobsy4 hm-heading">Paris Bag By Aspinal of London</h3></p><p class=affiliateProductListTitle_a1a518yz>Editor's Note</p><p>This just screams luxury and would look lovely on a trip to the office in 2024.&nbsp;</p><p>Handcrafted from the finest, responsibly sourced full-grain leather, this style is constructed using an origami-inspired design.&nbsp;<br></p></li><h2 data-gid=eJbuAyIF4duq>Aspinal of London delivery times</h2><p id=eOg5NYO8yqD data-wc=9>UK Standard Delivery (2-3 days working days) costing £4.95&nbsp;</p><p id=eSDoiLrPx_H data-wc=9>UK Express Delivery (1-2 days working days) costing £9.95.&nbsp;</p><p id=eHyJOhmdjnY data-wc=6>Non-UK details can be found <span><a class=hm-link href=# rel="sponsored noopener nofollow">online.&nbsp;</a></span></p><p id=eUvDzAtkycw data-wc=16>You must place your order no later than 1pm on the specific date for guaranteed delivery.&nbsp;</p><h2>Aspinal of London returns policy</h2><p id=eNy3mmvECJi data-wc=9>Different countries have different rules, but for the UK...</p><p id=eoFzNeG8ICs data-wc=55>For Outlet Items purchased online, you must return within 14 days.
