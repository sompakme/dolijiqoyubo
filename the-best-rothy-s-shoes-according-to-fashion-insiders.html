Knowing she would log tons of miles, she was searching for a <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-before-rewrite-localise=https://www.marieclaire.com/fashion/g32308971/comfortable-shoe-brands/>comfortable shoe</a> that could act as a sneaker alternative. She recalled a fellow style writer raving about their new shoes from the sustainably-minded direct-to-consumer footwear brand Rothy's— and with that vote of confidence, Veurink decided to grab a pair of <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-before-rewrite-localise=https://www.marieclaire.com/fashion/best-mary-janes/>Mary Janes</a> for her trip. That was the beginning of her love affair with the Rothy's brand—even taking pen to paper to write about her experience in The Strategist, an article Veurink says may be her most popular to date. Clocking 15,000 steps a day around Florence, combined with a week's worth of <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-before-rewrite-localise=https://www.marieclaire.com/fashion/g32223281/cute-spring-outfits/><u>spring outfits</u></a>, those stretchy knit Mary Janes kept Veurink's feet blister-free without a breaking-in period. Since then, she's worn them at least once a week. "I can safely say my Rothy's Mary Janes are my most-worn shoe," she tells Marie Claire.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/97oC6y79ysur6dDaVq3si9-1920-80.jpg><p>Veurink isn't the only content creator recently turned into a vocal Rothy's fan. Heather Hurst, style curator and writer of the fashion and design newsletter PIGPEN, knew her mother had been a Rothy's-wearer for years, but it wasn't until Hurst read her friend Veurink's article that she became intrigued by the shoe, tried the same Mary Jane style, and took to social media to post a glowing review for her nearly 170,000 TikTok followers. Style influencers’ seal of approval didn't stop there. <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# rel=sponsored data-url="https://www.instagram.com/natgawd/?hl=en" referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-hl-processed=none><u>Natalie Shine</u></a> also posted a tribute to the brand on her TikTok last spring that went viral—amassing 6.3 million views (and counting).

Co-founders Roth Martin and Stephen Hawthornthwaite launched the company with the goal of creating good-looking, comfortable shoes while reducing plastic waste in the process. With an <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-before-rewrite-localise=https://www.marieclaire.com/fashion/a20096692/all-female-executive-team-rothys-shoes/><u>all-female executive team</u></a> at the helm, Rothy's has utilized 166 million single-use bottles and over 603,000 pounds of ocean-bound plastics throughout its collections. In the process, they've raked in millions of customers and dedicated fan pages like a Rothy's Addicts group on Facebook and a dedicated sub-Reddit.</p><p>While the Mary Janes are a favorite, the brand has many other styles, including <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-before-rewrite-localise=https://www.marieclaire.com/fashion/g4585/cool-white-sneakers/><u>cool white sneakers</u></a> (worn by Emily Ratakowski), their newly launched <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-before-rewrite-localise=https://www.marieclaire.com/fashion/rothys-wedge-sandal-launch-2024-exclusive/><u>wedge sandals</u></a>, and essential <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-before-rewrite-localise=https://www.marieclaire.com/fashion/best-loafers-for-women/><u>loafer</u></a> styles. Ahead, we've rounded up the brand's most sought-after styles with insights from Veurink, Hurst, Shine, and Marie Claire editors, who have also become devout Rothy's fans. Try a pair, and we're willing to bet you'll turn into a convert, too.</p><h2 class=article-body__section id=section-shop-the-best-rothy-s-shoes><span>Shop the Best Rothy's Shoes</span></h2><a href=# data-model-name="The Square Mary Jane " rel="sponsored noopener" data-url=https://rothys.com/products/the-square-mary-jane-black referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-hl-processed=hawklinks data-placeholder-url="https://rothys.sjv.io/c/221109/1486151/17533?subId1=hawk-custom-tracking&sharedId=hawk-prefix&u=https%3A%2F%2Frothys.com%2Fproducts%2Fthe-square-mary-jane-black" data-google-interstitial=false data-merchant-name=rothys.com data-merchant-id=276193 data-merchant-url=rothys.com data-merchant-network=ImpactRad readability=1><p class=vanilla-image-block data-bordeaux-image-check><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/4CxGCh4hG7ef6WMS8thLCK-1920-80.jpg><span class="featured__label horizontal__label">Best Overall Rothy's Shoes</span></p></a><p>The Square Mary Jane</p><p>The Square Mary Janes are the style that made the brand go viral and are undoubtedly the most popular— often selling out of stock. They've got a similar silhouette to some of the <a href=# data-before-rewrite-localise=https://www.marieclaire.com/fashion/best-ballet-flats/>best ballet flats</a> in terms of style, but don't read as comfort-first. "The Mary Jane, in particular, feels elevated and easy," says Veurink. She styles them like a pair of loafers alongside pants, jeans, and dresses. What makes them go above and beyond, though, is their next-level comfort— meaning: "no digging in, no breaking in required, and nothing but ease from the minute you take them out of the box," Veurink explains.</p><a href=# data-model-name="The Casual Clog " rel="sponsored noopener" data-url=https://rothys.com/products/womens-casual-clog-dove referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-hl-processed=hawklinks data-placeholder-url="https://rothys.sjv.io/c/221109/1486151/17533?subId1=hawk-custom-tracking&sharedId=hawk-prefix&u=https%3A%2F%2Frothys.com%2Fproducts%2Fwomens-casual-clog-dove" data-google-interstitial=false data-merchant-name=rothys.com data-merchant-id=276193 data-merchant-url=rothys.com data-merchant-network=ImpactRad readability=1><p class=vanilla-image-block data-bordeaux-image-check><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/5M3frosGyZPv2zGSk5fqEK-1920-80.jpg><span class="featured__label horizontal__label">Best Casual Rothy's Shoes</span></p></a><p>The Casual Clog</p><p>The Casual Clog is a close runner-up to the square-toe Mary Jane in style, comfort, and popularity. These Birkenstock-esque shoes are akin to a fashion-forward slipper. They're Hurst's favorite pair of Rothy's, and she wears them every single day while walking with her dog. "Other clogs I've tried don't completely flow with my other clothes, so I love the classic, streamlined clog," she says. They're climbing up the ranks of daily footwear for Shine, too, who says, "they add a sort of Nancy-Meyers beachiness" to her errand running, and are "perfect with linen pants or some scrunched-up cozy socks in the colder months."</p><a href=# data-model-name="The Lug Loafer " rel="sponsored noopener" data-url=https://rothys.com/products/lug-sole-loafer-onyx-black referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-hl-processed=hawklinks data-placeholder-url="https://rothys.sjv.io/c/221109/1486151/17533?subId1=hawk-custom-tracking&sharedId=hawk-prefix&u=https%3A%2F%2Frothys.com%2Fproducts%2Flug-sole-loafer-onyx-black" data-google-interstitial=false data-merchant-name=rothys.com data-merchant-id=276193 data-merchant-url=rothys.com data-merchant-network=ImpactRad><p class=vanilla-image-block data-bordeaux-image-check><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/iXzmdzy5ThgArkCKbFUv9K-1920-80.jpg><span class="featured__label horizontal__label">Best Rothy's Work Shoes</span></p></a><p>The Lug Loafer</p><p>The best loafers are versatile, polished, and, most importantly, easy to wear on long commutes. This Rothy's pair checks all three of those boxes (and then some). "The Lug Loafers are the pair I suggest for all of my corporate friends who are sick of commuting in white sneakers," says Veurink. What makes these loafers especially worthwhile is their thick, sturdy bottom, which provides more durability. These versatile shoes pair with just about all of your <a href=# data-before-rewrite-localise=https://www.marieclaire.com/fashion/best-spring-work-outfits/>spring work outfits</a> and can even take you through the cooler months.</p><a href=# data-model-name="The Point II " rel="sponsored noopener" data-url=https://rothys.com/products/womens-pointed-toe-flat-camel-captoe referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-hl-processed=hawklinks data-placeholder-url="https://rothys.sjv.io/c/221109/1486151/17533?subId1=hawk-custom-tracking&sharedId=hawk-prefix&u=https%3A%2F%2Frothys.com%2Fproducts%2Fwomens-pointed-toe-flat-camel-captoe" data-google-interstitial=false data-merchant-name=rothys.com data-merchant-id=276193 data-merchant-url=rothys.com data-merchant-network=ImpactRad readability=1><p class=vanilla-image-block data-bordeaux-image-check><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/mdxARPiRypBuGPdQ4W2kDK-1920-80.jpg><span class="featured__label horizontal__label">Best Elevated Rothy's Shoes</span></p></a><p>The Point II</p><p>If you're looking for a dressy pair of shoes but don't want to subject your feet to the pain of wearing heels for hours, this pointed-toe style is a great alternative. If you're skeptical, look to <a href=# data-before-rewrite-localise=https://www.marieclaire.com/author/jenny-hollander/>Jenny Hollander</a>, MC's digital director, who wore these on her literal wedding day, and hasn't bought any other brand of flats since 2018. With a classy pointed cap toe, insoles with arch support, and a flexible outsole construction, it's easy to see why these are obsession-worthy.</p><a href=# data-model-name="The Lace-Up Sneaker " rel="sponsored noopener" data-url=https://rothys.com/products/the-lace-up-sneaker-bright-white referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-hl-processed=hawklinks data-placeholder-url="https://rothys.sjv.io/c/221109/1486151/17533?subId1=hawk-custom-tracking&sharedId=hawk-prefix&u=https%3A%2F%2Frothys.com%2Fproducts%2Fthe-lace-up-sneaker-bright-white" data-google-interstitial=false data-merchant-name=rothys.com data-merchant-id=276193 data-merchant-url=rothys.com data-merchant-network=ImpactRad><p class=vanilla-image-block data-bordeaux-image-check><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/8iXqT3ghHbcRDPnU8CZ2AK-1920-80.jpg><span class="featured__label horizontal__label">Best Rothy's Sneakers</span></p></a><p>The Lace-Up Sneaker</p><p>White sneakers are about as classic as footwear gets and deserve a spot in everyone's closet, but Rothy's Lace-Up Sneakers are a departure from just your average pair, solving traditional construction flaws, like stiff soles and excessive cushioning. Contributing Editor <a href=# data-before-rewrite-localise=https://www.marieclaire.com/author/katherine-j-igoe/>Katherine J. Igoe</a> has these sneakers in multiple colors. "The sole is bendy, not rigid, and it moves with my foot—but, thanks to the lace-up design, my foot also feels tightly secured without the risk of getting blisters," she says. This pair is also machine washable, preventing odors and dirt.</p><h3 class=article-body__section id=section-other-rothy-s-shoes-we-love><span>Other Rothy's Shoes We Love</span></h3><a href=# data-model-name="The Square Wrap " rel="sponsored noopener" data-url=https://rothys.com/products/the-square-wrap-jasper referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-hl-processed=hawklinks data-placeholder-url="https://rothys.sjv.io/c/221109/1486151/17533?subId1=hawk-custom-tracking&sharedId=hawk-prefix&u=https%3A%2F%2Frothys.com%2Fproducts%2Fthe-square-wrap-jasper" data-google-interstitial=false data-merchant-name=rothys.com data-merchant-id=276193 data-merchant-url=rothys.com data-merchant-network=ImpactRad readability=1><p class=vanilla-image-block data-bordeaux-image-check><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/HCsCuXRP8YrVskD2JDmkBK-1920-80.jpg><span class="featured__label horizontal__label">Best Versatile Rothy's Shoes</span></p></a><p>The Square Wrap</p><p>This is my first pair of Rothy's, and the instant I slipped them on, I knew I was a Rothy's convert. I've never had a shoe fit me so well—they quite literally molded to the shape of my feet like a pair of socks right out of the box. I took them for a test spin for a long day of running errands, and sure enough, they were just as comfortable as fans claimed. What really made them steal my heart, though, is their versatility— and their adjustable, removable strap. When I want to feel like the daintiest of ballerinas, I'll tie them around my ankles and pair them with a long skirt. When I want to look like the coolest of It girls, I'll remove the ties and throw on some baggy jeans.</p><a href=# data-model-name="The Lightweight Wedge Sandal " rel="sponsored noopener" data-url=https://rothys.com/products/platform-sandal-pepper referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-hl-processed=hawklinks data-placeholder-url="https://rothys.sjv.io/c/221109/1486151/17533?subId1=hawk-custom-tracking&sharedId=hawk-prefix&u=https%3A%2F%2Frothys.com%2Fproducts%2Fplatform-sandal-pepper" data-google-interstitial=false data-merchant-name=rothys.com data-merchant-id=276193 data-merchant-url=rothys.com data-merchant-network=ImpactRad readability=1><p class=vanilla-image-block data-bordeaux-image-check><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/HUfktb7H5JBZLBcSWMCjCK-1920-80.jpg><span class="featured__label horizontal__label">Best Heeled Rothy's Shoes</span></p></a><p>The Lightweight Wedge Sandal</p><p>Rothy's does it all and does it well, from flats, sneakers, loafers, and now the addition of sandals. In a departure from their go-to flat styles, the brand launched these wedge sandals back in March, and sizes are already starting to sell out. Even with their first "heeled" shoe, Rothy's still prioritized comfort in this design with a molded footbed, lightweight foamy stacked sole, and extra stretchy straps that move with your foot. Platforms and wedges reign as a top <a href=# data-before-rewrite-localise=https://www.marieclaire.com/fashion/spring-2024-shoe-trends/>spring 2024 shoe trend</a>, and Rothy's take on the style feels especially approachable with a sensible amount of height and neutral shades to pair with all of your <a href=# data-before-rewrite-localise=https://www.marieclaire.com/fashion/g116/summer-dresses/>summer dresses</a>.</p><a href=# data-model-name="The Driver " rel="sponsored noopener" data-url=https://rothys.com/products/the-driver-latte referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-hl-processed=hawklinks data-placeholder-url="https://rothys.sjv.io/c/221109/1486151/17533?subId1=hawk-custom-tracking&sharedId=hawk-prefix&u=https%3A%2F%2Frothys.com%2Fproducts%2Fthe-driver-latte" data-google-interstitial=false data-merchant-name=rothys.com data-merchant-id=276193 data-merchant-url=rothys.com data-merchant-network=ImpactRad readability=1><p class=vanilla-image-block data-bordeaux-image-check><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/XLN5dMQxYqsczfgTHrYUEK-1920-80.jpg><span class="featured__label horizontal__label">Best Rothy's Shoes for Walking</span></p></a><p>The Driver</p><p><a href=# data-before-rewrite-localise=https://www.marieclaire.com/author/gabrielle-ulubay/>Gabrielle Ulubay</a>, MC's beauty writer, had never been a fan of loafers until she tried this pair of Rothy's. "I always believed that boots and heels aligned more with my personal style than this famously preppy look. Rothy's changed all of that," she says. "These are by far the most comfortable shoes I own, and they look great with everything from dresses to jeans." Don't mistake these as just another pair of loafers, though. These have a more casual feel with a gum outsole and matching raised nubs meant to add more grip when you're actually driving (a great detail even if you don't get behind the wheel).</p><a href=# data-model-name="The Weekend Slide " rel="sponsored noopener" data-url=https://rothys.com/products/weekend-slide-sandals-black referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-hl-processed=hawklinks data-placeholder-url="https://rothys.sjv.io/c/221109/1486151/17533?subId1=hawk-custom-tracking&sharedId=hawk-prefix&u=https%3A%2F%2Frothys.com%2Fproducts%2Fweekend-slide-sandals-black" data-google-interstitial=false data-merchant-name=rothys.com data-merchant-id=276193 data-merchant-url=rothys.com data-merchant-network=ImpactRad readability=1><p class=vanilla-image-block data-bordeaux-image-check><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/n8oHmkZUfURxMzCeVHMvCK-1920-80.jpg><span class="featured__label horizontal__label">Best Off-Duty Rothy's Shoes</span></p></a><p>The Weekend Slide</p><p>Everything you need to know about this shoe is in the name.

The classic silhouette should be a mainstay for those wanting to replicate that je ne sais quoi all French women seem to have. The flat shoe has garnered a bad rep for having zero arch support, but you won't have to worry about that with Rothy's version. "This is the only pair of ballet flats my feet can tolerate all day (and all night) long," says Marie Claire's Ulubay, who picked up this pair hoping to champion Amy Winehouse's signature ballet flats. They're so lightweight she feels nearly barefoot in them. The little bow detail adds a bit of elegance to this inherently classy shoe, and there are plenty of colors and prints— from minimalist to statement-making.</p><h2 class=article-body__section id=section-what-makes-rothy-s-different><span>What Makes Rothy's Different</span></h2><ul><li><strong>Sustainability</strong></li></ul><p>Known for their commitment to sustainability, Rothy's circular approach is built into every part of the shoe-making process and they're the world’s first shoe manufacturer to receive both LEED Gold and TRUE Zero Waste Platinum certification. Each pair of shoes is crafted from single-use water bottles that are then converted into the brand's signature fiber and used throughout their collections. They also make their footbeds out of algae and incorporate natural and renewable materials in their outsoles. Not only do they divert an average of 90 percent of their design material from landfills, but the brand also has a recycling program to turn used shoes back into raw fibers that can be given a second or third life.</p><p>Their sustainable practices are admirable, but the brand is also critically acclaimed for its comfort. Veurink's 15,000 steps were made easier thanks to Rothy's signature moldable knit fabric and seamless construction, which results in a soft, flexible hand feel— meaning they're ready to go right out of the box—no breaking-in required. Rothy's shoes also have a trademarked insole design, that includes a plush cushion and arch support.</p><ul><li><strong>Machine-washable</strong></li></ul><p>Another major selling point of Rothy's shoes? They're all machine-washable. Simply remove the insoles and throw them in the wash alongside the shoe. The brand recommends running the delicate cycle with cold water, and mild detergent, Air-dry them and they're as good as new.</p><h2 class=article-body__section id=section-how-to-style-the-best-rothy-s-shoes><span>How to Style the Best Rothy's Shoes</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/4CxGCh4hG7ef6WMS8thLCK-1920-80.jpg><p>Rothy's sneakers are easy to style.
