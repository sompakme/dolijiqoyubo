Many of us fall somewhere in the middle. We may splurge on a pair of compression leggings designed to wick sweat and aid recovery, but on top we’re wearing an old, oversized cotton t-shirt. So, does it really matter what you wear in the gym?</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=1 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Well, research say it does, revealing a direct correlation between what we wear and how we perform, as well as our motivation levels and even likelihood of injury.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=2 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">To explain more, Nick Harris, a top human performance expert who created <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=http://www.hpeclothing.com data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="HPE Activewear" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">HPE Activewear</a>, shares his specialist advice on how what we wear to do exercise can impact our workout:</p><h2 data-node-id=4 class="body-h2 css-p3fpzg emevuu60">1. It can prevent injury</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=5 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">“Wearing appropriate clothing is crucial when you are an avid exerciser. Many sport injuries occur because of the lack of appropriate equipment, including clothes. Whichever activity you are engaged in, you should opt for the clothing for that particular sport, looking for something that provides ample protection against impact, strain, or overheating.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=6 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">“I’d advise investing in good quality compression wear, this type of kit increases circulation and blood flow to the heart, delivering much needed oxygen to working muscles, reducing fatigue and soreness by managing lactic acid accumulation, helping to improve power, endurance and recovery.”</p><h2 data-node-id=8 class="body-h2 css-p3fpzg emevuu60">2. You won’t feel restricted</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=9 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">“Lightweight materials and well-designed active wear should feel like a second skin, ensuring you don’t feel restricted while you train. Exercising in total comfort will allow you to solely concentrate on the task at hand, and workout to the best of your ability. Choosing clothing that allows full range of movement is incredibly important, so when choosing fitness clothing, pay close attention to the design and tailoring, opting for seamless kit which won’t irritate your skin, or rub.”</p><h2 data-node-id=10 class="body-h2 css-p3fpzg emevuu60">3. It regulates and controls body temperature</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=11 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">“An intense session at the gym will leave you thankful that you didn’t wear that old cotton top, as cotton absorbs sweat easily and retains moisture, leaving you feeling damp and heavy. You should opt for light, breathable and sweat-wicking fabrics which will draw moisture away from the body, leaving you feeling dry and comfortable. Intelligent fabrics like XT Air, or XT Air ICE will also help to regulate and maintain your body temperature to ensure you can perform at your best, in the ultimate comfort.”</p><h2 data-node-id=12 class="body-h2 css-p3fpzg emevuu60">4. It can improve performance</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=13 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">“You’ve no doubt heard the phrase, ‘dress for success’, and this can apply to what you wear in the gym. High quality, intelligent fabrics work with the body to accelerate performance, withstanding the rigours of intense training to keep you performing at your best. When it comes to improved performance, comfort is again key. You should opt for fitness clothing which is really designed for your chosen activity. If you’re likely to get sweaty, look for sweat-wicking fabrics which draw moisture away from the body and seek out FRESHFIT technology which incorporates silver ions, designed to resist bacterial build up and keep you feeling fresh.”</p><h2 data-node-id=15 class="body-h2 css-p3fpzg emevuu60">5. It can boost confidence</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=16 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">“Clothing can be empowering in everyday life, and when it comes to working out, contributing to our confidence levels and raising self-esteem. Indeed, there’s even a psychological phenomenon called “enclothed cognition” which suggests that the clothing a person wears can trigger mental changes that positively affect their performance and confidence level. In the simplest terms, when you look good, you feel more confident, so investing in gym kit which makes you feel the part can help you to feel better in the gym and truly conquer a workout.”</p><h2 data-node-id=17 class="body-h2 css-p3fpzg emevuu60">6. It affects your skin</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=18 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">“Low quality and often cheap active wear can contain fabrics which irritate the skin, causing rashes and itching during a workout. Exercise increases the flow of blood to your skin, and this can also result in itchiness. Sweat, dehydration, wearing tight clothing that prevents your skin from breathing and washing your workout attire in harsh detergents can cause also contribute to skin issues. Intense exercise can also cause clogging of your sweat glands, resulting in an itchy heat rash, so do make sure that you opt for light, breathable fabrics which keep your skin cool.”</p><h2 data-node-id=19 class="body-h2 css-p3fpzg emevuu60">7. It can motivate you</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=20 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">“Nothing motivates you to go the gym more than new kit. Not only will you feel good, but you’ll look good, and that’s something you want when surrounded by mirrors in the gym. Unfortunately, buying new gym clothes every time you go through a workout slump can be expensive. To combat this, we’ve created a new, quarterly subscription box service which will help users to curate a collection of luxurious, highly technical fitness clothing from <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=http://www.hpeclothing.com data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="HPE Activewear" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">HPE Activewear</a><span></span>. This new service will also offer customers significant savings on our best-selling products and fabric technologies, with the ‘build your own box’ option allowing you to choose from a wide range of colour and designs to suit your chosen exercise and lifestyle.”</p><img data-dynamic-svg=true src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.harpersbazaar.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/play.db7c035.svg?primary=%2523ffffff" data-testid=dynamic-svg-base height=24 width=24 alt="Play Icon" role=img title=Play style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><img alt="preview for The ultimate guide to luxury sportswear" title="Video player poster image" width=2000 height=1000 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/vidthumb/d0560b21-6555-4e11-8d40-d31e7b9155b3/thumb_1920x1080_00001_1516987712_42167.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><h6 class="css-ok56rr e94w1mj3"><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span><span class="css-8lle59 e94w1mj1">Related Story</span><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span></h6><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qa3RqZyrq5KWx6Kt0WeaqKVfqrhwrsSarK2xX5u2tbrErKpmr5WhuaOxyKeeaJlhaoZ2gI9sZ2iolaezsL7MmqWcnV2cxq551p6Yq2Wknr20ew%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestD - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
