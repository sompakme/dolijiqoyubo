Kendall Jenner, the most reserved of her famous kin, rarely addresses personal matters on a public scale; however, new rumours have compelled the fashion model and mogul to reveal some closely-guarded information about her life.&nbsp;</p><p><a href=# class=text-word rel>The Internet</a>&nbsp;has been ablaze with recent reports that suggest Jenner is a lesbian. Speaking with&nbsp;Vogue, the&nbsp;Keeping Up with the Kardashians&nbsp;star reveals that "I don’t think I have a bisexual or gay bone in my body, but I don’t know! Who knows?! I’m all down for experience —not against it whatsoever — but I’ve never been there before."</p><p>When probed as to why the public may perceive her in this light, Jenner admits that " I think it’s because I’m not like all my other sisters, who are, like, ‘Here’s me and my boyfriend!' So it was a thing for a minute because no one ever saw me with a guy. I would always go that extra mile to be low-key with guys, sneaking around all the time. You don’t want to, like, look crazy."</p><p>Jenner&nbsp;concludes her answer by plainly stating "I’m not gay. I have literally nothing to hide. I would never hide something like that."</p><p>When asked whether she is currently involved in a relationship, Jenner remained tightlipped about her and rumoured boyfriend Blake Griffin. She does admit that she&nbsp;currently has "someone being very nice to me," who makes her feel happy.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvTp5ywoJmltbC8jZympmdhZYJ4gJhmop6mlJa5rXnJnqWnnaJisaa6yJ6qZp%2BRrnqzwcyorKurXaeyt7HApapmnJWprqq40mamn2WSoa6ssYygqaKelp67br7EpZitoZ%2BjwKm1z2alnq%2Bj</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestD - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
