He often fell asleep in his chair while making art, Lisa said, but she knew something was wrong as she walked toward him. “I started shaking him and screaming. I pushed him hard, and he fell on the floor. I tried to resuscitate him—mouth to mouth—and I was compressing him,” she recalled, sobbing. “I was screaming for my neighbor because I didn’t want to leave him and call 911, and I just kept at it until they took him away.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=7 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">“I miss him so much. He was the love of my life,” she said.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=8 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">One week prior, Angus and his twin sisters had spread the ashes of their father, Conor Hickey. Lisa said all three kids were devastated and in mourning.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=9 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">On September 21, the Alameda County Coroner’s Bureau said it had determined Angus’s cause of death was acute intoxication from an accidental overdose of drugs: fentanyl and benzodiazepines (antidepressants), mixed with cocaine and methamphetamine.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=10 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">“It was predominantly the central nervous system depressants. It started to slow his heart and slow his breathing,” Lisa explained. “He got tired from lack of oxygen. Everything just slowed down, and eventually his heart stopped and he went to sleep. But he didn’t kill himself.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=11 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Lisa said that despite her grief, she is thankful for the love and support she’s received, not only from her loved ones, but also from Angus’s friends and fans, since his death. “He went out at his total power, his total beauty, his total influence, and the reaction that everyone has had is very moving to me. You know, he’s not just an actor who overdosed. He was a beautiful soul, and that’s why people miss him so much,” she said.</p><span class="css-3mrz81 ev8dhu51"><img src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/rover/profile_photos/49ca5303-a74f-4d73-a0f8-6a94e1338358_1714666618.file?fill=1:1&resize=120:*" alt="Headshot of Rosa Sanchez" title="Headshot of Rosa Sanchez" width=100% height=100% decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></span><p>Rosa Sanchez is the senior news editor at Harper's Bazaar, working on news as it relates to entertainment, fashion, and culture.
