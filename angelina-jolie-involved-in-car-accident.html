The Hollywood star was travelling in a hire car that skidded in the rain and hit a curb, with the impact exploding two of the vehicle's tires. "The car slammed into the curb at significant speed," an eyewitness told X17 Online. "Angelina must have wondered if they hit another car.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/49eaf5fe07b6-angelina-z.jpg><p id=esCXZLUqJUsi data-wc=77>"It was pretty bad – the tire exploded and it's amazing nothing worse happened to the car. I wouldn't be surprised if she had whiplash." According to the website, Angelina Jolie, 39, was picked up soon after the incident by another driver in a second hire car. Just a few hours earlier, the actress had made a special appearance at a cinema in Beverly Hills for a screening of Unbroken, the war drama she produced and directed.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/480702c84b20-direct-z.jpg><p id=eaSIq8DtQUgg data-wc=76>The film charts the incredible life of World War II hero Louis Zamperini – a former Olympic track star who spent 47 days afloat in the Pacific Ocean after his military plane crashed, and more than two and a half years living in Japanese prisoner of war camps. Of the movie, which includes some hard-hitting scenes from Louis' imprisonment, Angelina has said, "It's not about separation and division. This man's life is about forgiveness and unity.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/d057dc082648-angelina-louis-z.jpg><p id=ek18OJQYUPj1 data-wc=95>"My own children have watched it and they walked out of it and thought he was a hero." Unsurprisingly, Unbroken&nbsp;is being tipped as a real Oscar contender, with critics praising British star Jack O'Connell, the film's cinematography and director Angelina. It also received a standing ovation when it screened for the SAG Nominating Committee. However for Angelina there was just one opinion that truly counted – Louis'. Speaking about showing the 97-year-old the film shortly before he died in July, and how much he loved it, she noted, "That's the only review that matters."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbHLpaammZeWx6q6xGeaqKVfmLKtscGroK2hlah8c3yQbWhraGFnf3KFmGiYp5%2BVobavrYyjpqWhlWKwor6MmpqcoZSau7V7</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestD - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
