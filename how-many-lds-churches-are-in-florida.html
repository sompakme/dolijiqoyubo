A Not-So-Scientific Investigation</h2><p data-sourcepos=3:1-3:102><span>Florida:</span><span> land of theme parks,</span><span> alligators,</span><span> and...</span><span> surprisingly,</span><span> a fair number of Latter-day Saints (LDS) churches.</span><span> But just how many are we talking about?</span><span> Buckle up,</span><span> scripture scholars,</span><span> because we're about to

data-sourcepos=7:1-7:41><span>The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (that's the official,</span><span> mouthful name) keeps its membership numbers close to the vest.</span><span> But fear not,</span><span> intrepid data detectives!</span><span> We can use some Sherlock Holmes-level deduction (okay,</span><span> maybe more like internet sleuthing) to get an idea.</span></p><p data-sourcepos=9:1-9:203><span>Here's what we know:</span><span> Florida boasts a vibrant LDS community,</span><span> estimated at around 168,</span><span>527 members – that's roughly 1% of the state's population.</span><span> </span><strong>Impressive, right?</strong><span> Almost as impressive as a perfectly-executed flamingo pose at sunrise (just sayin').</span></p><p

things get a little more interesting.</span><span> There are two main types of LDS congregations:</span><span> branches and stakes.</span><span> Branches are smaller groups,</span><span> while stakes are larger,</span><span> kind of like regional headquarters.</span></p><p data-sourcepos=15:1-15:330><span>Here's the tricky part:</span><span> pinpointing the exact number of branches is like counting grains of sand on a Florida beach (minus the sunburn,</span><span> thankfully).</span><span> However,</span><span> thanks to some online resources,</span><span> we can get close.</span><span> One source suggests there are around </span><strong>282 total congregations</strong><span> in Florida,</span><span> while another points to </span><strong>53 branches</strong><span>.</span></p><p data-sourcepos=18:1-18:64><strong>So, what gives?</strong><span> This discrepancy might be because some congregations are considered "wards" which fall under a stake,</span><span> rather than separate branches.</span><span> Don't worry,</span><span> you don't need a theology degree to understand – the important takeaway is that there are plenty of LDS churches throughout Florida.</span></p><p
