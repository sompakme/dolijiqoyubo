In a new video for&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2>Vogue</a>, the actress and mother said that she found the event to be "a little scary" and that, although she remembers her time there fondly, she hasn't been back since. Garner attended the event in 2007.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"I went to the Met ball exactly one time," Garner said. "I found it a little scary, so I haven't been back."&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_5-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The theme that year was "Poiret: King of Fashion" and the exhibit honored the late designer Paul Poiret, who was known for adding modernity to the very restrictive styles of women's clothing at the time. Garner went to the event with designer Valentino Garavani.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_7-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"I wore — that night — this magical red Valentino gown," she remembered. "And I was his date and that was really majestic and special."&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_11-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Of course, Garner isn't against attending other major red carpets. Just this year, she attended the White House State Dinner with her daughter, Violet, and she regularly steps out to promote her films.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_15-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>People</a>&nbsp;reports that in 2018, Garner wrote about her experience at the Gala on Instagram.<br></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_17-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“You will never appreciate using the bathroom alone until you’ve been sewn into a dress — Met Gala 2007,” she posted alongside a throwback pic.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_19-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner readability=27><p>Evan Agostini/Getty Images</p></span></figure><figure id=mntl-sc-block_20-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner readability=27><p>CHANCE YEH/Patrick McMullan via Getty Images</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_21-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The publication also notes that Garner isn't alone in having strong feelings about the event.
