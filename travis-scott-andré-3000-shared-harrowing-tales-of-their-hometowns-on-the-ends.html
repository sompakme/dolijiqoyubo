Following the release of back-to-back heat on 2014's&nbsp;Days Before Rodeo and his debut studio album&nbsp;Rodeo&nbsp;in 2015, all eyes were on Travis Scott to see if he was going to be able to make that leap and join Hip-Hop's upper echelon of artists. And although he officially reached superstardom with&nbsp;Astroworld&nbsp;in 2018, it was his sophomore album,&nbsp;Birds in the Trap Sing McKnight which paved the way for the Houston rapper's meteoric rise.</p><p>Frazer Harrison/Getty Images</p><p>Packed with high-quality guest features from Hip-Hop&nbsp;mainstays&nbsp;like <a href=# class=text-word rel>Kid Cudi</a> and <a href=# class=text-word rel>Kendrick Lamar</a> as well as sensational new artists like 21 Savage and <a href=# class=text-word rel>Nav</a>,&nbsp;BITTSM was an indulgent offering from Travis that truly pushed him to his limits as a songwriter and a <a href=# class=text-word rel>Kanye West</a>-esque album curator. Aside from the album's&nbsp;octuple&nbsp;platinum&nbsp;track "Goosebumps," one of the most incredible moments on&nbsp;Birds in the Trap Sing McKnight was its&nbsp;Andr√© 3000-assisted intro, titled "the ends." Both artists paint horrifying pictures of their hometowns, yet the end result is still eerily beautiful.</p><p>Celebrate the five-year anniversary of Travis Scott's game-changing sophomore studio album&nbsp;Birds in the Trap Sing McKnight by revisiting the record's dark intro below.
