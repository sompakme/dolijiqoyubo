You may have noticed the absence of “Gaga” in her name, it is because it is a stage name inspired by the Queen’s Song,&nbsp;</span><strong><span>Radio Gaga</span></strong></li><li><span>When people don’t call her Stefani or Lady Gaga, people call her Gagaloo, Loopy, Mother Monster, Rabbit Teeth or Little Mermaid.</span></li><li><span>She has one of the most colorful wardrobes, but her favorite colors are actually black and lavender.</span></li></ul></li></ul><ul><li><ul><li><span>Lady Gaga’s musical talent is very natural and deeply rooted;&nbsp;she learned to play the piano just by listening at the age of 4, and at the age of 13 she began composing her own original ballads.</span></li><li><span>She was inspired to pursue her own musical career by Akon.&nbsp;Yes, before her stardom, Gaga was a songwriter for other successful singers.&nbsp;It was Akon who gave him a nudge in the right direction.</span></li><li><span>She was enrolled at the State University of New York, but dropped out at the age of 19 in order to pursue her music career.</span></li><li><span>Despite this, Gaga is highly educated, she is a vocally trained professional singer trained in classical music and she even studied at Juilliard.</span></li><li><span>Her resemblance to the late Amy Winehouse is uncanny, so to make a statement, the star dyed her hair blonde.</span></li><li><span>The natural brunette has a thing for her fans, she once ordered $1000 worth of Dad John’s Pizza when she saw a number of them waiting outside a recording studio for her.</span></li><li><span>The artist takes an occasional whiff of “ganja” to get his creative juices flowing.</span></li></ul></li></ul><p><span>Before we get completely carried away, let’s tackle the current topic by starting with Lady

know that the Artist is a bit short…did we say a bit?&nbsp;Lady Gaga is very short and we have the numbers to prove it.&nbsp;She’s not that tall at 5 feet and one inch.&nbsp;Although she has a very big personality and throws a big shade on her ass, Lady Gaga is one of the smallest stars.</span></p><p><span>The only people she could possibly stand taller than standing barefoot are Nicole ‘Snooki’ Polizzi (4ft 5in), Ariana Grande (5ft 0in), Jada Pinkett-Smith (5ft 0in), Lil Kim ( 4-foot-11) and Kristen Chenoweth.</span></p><p><span>Yes!&nbsp;No wonder she needs to climb on a pair of high heels once in a while.&nbsp;After identifying a few celebrities who are said to be shorter than Lady Gaga, it’s only fair that we take a look at a few others who are as tall as the entertainer.&nbsp;Avril Lavigne, Nicole Richie, Christina Ricci and Kristen Bell all share Lady Gaga’s height.</span></p><p><span>See Also: Scarlett Johansson Height, Weight, Bra Size and Net Worth</span></p><h2><span>Lady

and sexy.&nbsp;Anyway, between 2013 and 2014, the star started putting on extra pounds.</span></p><p><span>Trust the media, she’s been criticized on all fronts, but you know Gaga is no pushover.&nbsp;She blasted her body shamers in a series of social statements, one of them being a series of tweets after a photo she posted on Instagram brought in the negative comments.</span></p><p><span>She also took to Instagram and posted another image in the same swimsuit captioned, “#bodyrevolution Proud at any size, because the inside is what really matters.&nbsp;Also, it all depends on how you pose!&nbsp;Just ask the models.&nbsp;“Last year, the star took a page from Khloe Kardashians book and came back with a body of revenge.</span></p><p><span>She lost weight quickly with yoga sessions and a low glycemic diet, so her detractors have now become her admirers.&nbsp;Despite the weight loss, Gaga has always urged young girls to empower themselves and not get caught up in self-destructive cycles of crash dieting and self-loathing.</span></p><p><span>Here’s what she said on top of that: “This is who I am and I’m proud of any size.”</span></p><p><span>See also: Is Jason Statham married or does he have a girlfriend?</span></p><h2><span>Lady Gaga body measurements</span></h2><p><span>Along with Lady Gaga’s
