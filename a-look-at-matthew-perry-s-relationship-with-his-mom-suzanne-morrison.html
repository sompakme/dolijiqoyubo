At the age of five, the actor got shuttled back and forth from Los Angeles, where his dad lived, to Ottawa, Canada, his new home with his mom, Suzanne Morrison. After the move, Morrison got a job working for Pierre Trudeau, which sometimes meant having to work around the clock. In Perry's memoir, he recalled watching "Annie Hall" with his mom and Trudeau calling their home phone, per Ottawa's <a href=#>City News Everywhere</a>. "That is my absolute favorite childhood memory â€” sitting with my mom and watching that movie. But now the prime minister of Canada was calling, so I was about to lose my mom again," he wrote. "As she took the call I heard her turn on her professional, spinmeister-y voice; the voice of a different person, of Suzanne Perry in fact, not my mom," Perry continued.</p><p dir=ltr>Morrison remarried when Perry was 12 and he remembered giving her away as she walked down the aisle, Diane Sawyer stated during her interview with the late actor, per <a href=#>ABC News</a>. Although Perry was surrounded by stepparents and siblings, he still felt lonely growing up and used humor to get through the tough times.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmamxjaIV1fY6mmK2smJrEbrzEq6myZZ2kum6%2F1LOYp6aVYrqwvtGiqqimXaeyra3Toqanq5ievXA%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestD - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
