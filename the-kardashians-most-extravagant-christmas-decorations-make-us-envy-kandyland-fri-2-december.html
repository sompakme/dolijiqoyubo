The family matriarch, Kris Jenner, began the tradition in 1978. She continued the annual event until 2019 when she passed on the hosting baton to Kim.</p><p>At the time, the Skims founder revealed on KUWTK: “Our Christmas Eve party was always this fun party that I just remember being friends and family and my grandparents and cousins. It was just the best night ever.</p><p>“But my mom’s been doing it for so long that it’s turned into something different.”</p><p>Kim explained the invite list was mostly her mom’s friends. Therefore, when she became the host, she made it a “good mix” of everyone’s closest companions.</p><p>As we all know, Kris is prone to crying, and let’s just say it was an “emotional” moment for the momager.</p><p>Kris explained: “It’s not just a party. It’s changing of the guards.”</p><p>After Kim’s Christmas Eve party, she decided to pass the hosting duties on to sister Kourtney in the years that followed.</p><p>Of course, the pandemic means the 2020 and 2021 Christmas Eve party was just with their inner circle and their kids. This year, fans can’t wait to see what the Kardashian-Jenner family have up their sleeves…</p><p>WATCH THE KARDASHIANS ON HULU AND DISNEY+ NOW</p><p><strong>AND GET FREAKY WITH US ON <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">INSTAGRAM</a>, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">FACEBOOK</a>, <a href=# rel=nofollow>TWITTER</a> AND <a href=# rel=nofollow>TIKTOK</a></strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7s7HApaCtsaSewaO102eaqKVfm7KiwNSrnKxnpJ2ybrfAq5uaq5ierq%2B%2FjKamrKxdmsW1vsCvmKCZnql6pLTRoqqtpZGoeqWxwqipmqyZpLu0ecyaop5lpah6prrVsmSkmZ6Zxq2tzZ0%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestD - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
