Recently, the artist came through for his dedicated fanbase with a track called "Fuck My Cousin," and as you can gather from this title, Osama was looking to be provocative, and it most certainly paid off for him.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Throughout this track, Osama raps about his opps and betrayal.
