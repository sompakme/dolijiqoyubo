According to <a class=hm-link href=# rel=nofollow>Parade</a>, she first crossed paths with Steve in the mid-2000s.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/7636d1e98b72-steve-martin-anne-stringfield-at-galas.jpg><p id=erc0lQgxdGP data-wc=36>After calling the actor to fact-check the New Yorker's information on him, the pair formed an instant connection. "We talked on the phone for a year before we even met," Steve told <a class=hm-link href=# rel=nofollow>AARP Magazine</a> in 2017.&nbsp;</p><p id=eBLXIH5lmQD data-wc=61>After dating for around three years, it was confirmed that the couple – who share a 26-year age gap – had tied the knot in July 2007 at Steve's home in LA. The Cheaper by the Dozen star's publicist, Alan Nierob, revealed that the bride and groom had invited guests to a party, before announcing that it was actually their wedding.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/dbb49e16ab23-steve-martin-anne-stringfield-smiling.jpg><p id=eVi6g6-nQF2 data-wc=29>Among the star-studded guest list, Tom Hanks, Eugene Levy, Diane Keaton and Carl Reiner were in attendance. Meanwhile, Saturday Night Live&nbsp;creator Lorne Michaels acted as Steve's best man.&nbsp;</p><p id=eHD7VMVNnfs data-wc=66>While Steve and Anne (who has never walked the red carpet) are both extremely private, the Hollywood star has spoken about his wife in a few interviews. Talking to <a class=hm-link href=# rel=nofollow>PEOPLE</a> in 2015, he called his relationship with Anne, "an important episode in my life". Steve added: "She makes it all possible. She has one of the most important qualities a person can have, and that's kindness."</p><p id=eGIXoMXSNH2 data-wc=58>In the same interview, Steve also noted that Anne bears a striking resemblance to his&nbsp;Only Murders in the Building co-star and close friend, Tina Fey – which has become a running joke. To the delight of fans, Anne actually cameod as one of Cinda Canning's (Tina Fey) lookalike assistants in season two – did you spot her?</p><p id=eMrNAF-DkjU data-wc=16><strong>DISCOVER:&nbsp;</strong><a class=hm-link href=#>Only Murders in the Building season 3: everything to know from release date to plot</a></p><p id=e1GP1GKOkJ7 data-wc=12><strong>READ:&nbsp;</strong><a class=hm-link href=#>Only Murders in the Building: your ultimate recap before season 3</a></p><h2 dir=ltr>Steve Martin's daughter Mary Martin</h2><p id=e53vrloZRce data-wc=56>Steve and Anne welcomed their only child, a daughter called Mary, in December 2012. The couple, who are notoriously private, initially refrained from revealing her name. Months after their daughter was born, Steve was invited on David Letterman's talk show in 2013, where he remained coy about his little one, joking that he'd named her, "Conquistador."&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/fe4b14b6d7f9-steve-martin-anne-stringfield-gallery.jpg><p id=eyni34mD-ix data-wc=57>Reflecting on his journey into fatherhood in 2017, Steve told AARP Magazine: "I think if I'd had a child earlier, I would have been a lousy father because I would have misplaced my attention on my career," he said. "I am very forthcoming with her, and it's great. She's giving me way more than I'm giving her."</p><p id=eDgEai2LcnP data-wc=57>Steve sweetly added that his wife and daughter have brought him "real happiness." Asked how he'd describe his life now, he replied: "Very, very happy. I mean, it's actually the perfect shape of a life. Except for the hard parts in the beginning — the disharmony, panic, pain, with occasional moments of great affection and comedy success."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbHLpaammZeWx6q6xGeaqKVfnbKiuNOhmKeckpqutsDYaKSorJiav26tzZ1km5mSrnx1hZhwbm5nn6O5unnMrqmdnaKoeqq6jK2fnmWSqratsMinnmarpJrDpnnMmqmtoZ5is6K5yKWwZqSZm7Juw8ifnGaZnqOybr%2FTq6Cnn5aesq2wjJ2Yrp%2BYqbKzecyaqbJn</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestD - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
