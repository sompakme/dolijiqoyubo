To recap, Rock is pregnant with BlueFace's baby. However, the dysfunctional couple is very much not together during this pregnancy. As recently as May 20, Rock made it clear that she intends to go through this <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">pregnancy without BlueFace's involvement</a>.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">For his part, BlueFace has definitely turned himself into the villain of the story. Last Sunday, he got slammed for a <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">viral clip of him harassing a woman while out clubbing</a>. Now he's caught the ire of R&B legend <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Erykah Badu</a>. After BlueFace posted a photo of him surrounded by women on a boat to Instagram, Badu took a screenshot and posted it to her story. Furthermore, she added the caption "He's trash Universe do your thing."</p><span><h2 class="__className_a6f35b font-bold text-2xl lg:text-[2.125rem] mb-[18px] font-poppins leading-10" id=h-karlissa-saffold-claps-back>Karlissa Saffold Claps Back</h2></span><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">However, Saffold's comments have not been met with support. "She ainâ€™t called Tyrone in over 2 decades lady," one commentator wrote (Badu's single "Tyrone" turns 26 this year). "Now what you not gone do is come for Badu please sit tf down," added another Badu stan. "I need her to sit down expeditiously after her son allowed her to get beat up by another woman in his presence! Silence yourself Muvah," commented a third. These three comments, all found on a post from The Shade Room, have more than 25,000 combined likes. Looks like Saffold's taking an L on this one.
