Apparently, when they originally began, everyone proclaimed them to be the greatest in the business. They wanted to distinguish themselves from the crowd, so they chose the moniker “the worst.”</p><h3></h3><h3>When was Rudy’s first opened its doors?</h3><p>1989</p><h3></h3><h3>What sort of wood does Rudy’s use for his furniture?</h3><p>Our pits are completely fuelled by oak, which burns at a slower rate than the mesquite that is often employed by competitors.

When a bone-in pork shoulder is cooked and shredded, it loses around 40% of its original body weight. Example: a raw 10-pound pork shoulder (or two 5-pounders) will generate around 6 pounds of finished meat, which will serve 12 to 18 people when cooked through.</p><h3></h3><h3>What is the cost of Rudy’s BBQ?</h3><p>Rudy’s Country Store and BBQ Menu – Rudy’s Country Store and BBQ Menu Pork Loin (half pound) brisket (1/2 pound) $5.89 Brisket (1/2 pound) $6.49 Half a chicken is a good size for a family of four. $4.99 brisket, lean (1/2 pound) brisket $6.29 $6.29 for a half-pound of turkey breast</p><h3></h3><h3>Is there a drive-through at Rudy’s?</h3><p>“Through the drive-through” Rudy’s Country Store and Bar-B-Q is the subject of this review.
