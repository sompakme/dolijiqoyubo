In a 2021 interview with Ozy, she opened up about how she created content while working her 9-to-5. "I was absolutely in insurance; Allstate to be exact. I've always been me. So, with that being said, I've always just been apparently naturally funny," she said, adding, "So, being on a job, having extra time when a boss is out playing golf or networking, I was like, 'You know what? I am going to go ahead and create some fun for myself in the office.'"</p><p dir=ltr>"At that time, social media was fairly new, so I would prop up my phone and just create content from there. Next thing you know, people started requesting to book me and stuff," Milan continued. "I was like, 'I'm making more money on these bookings than I am biweekly at this job.' I was just like, 'I got to go ahead and chase my dream real quick to be an entertainer,' and that's what I did."</p><p dir=ltr>Milan explained it took two years for her comedy career to take off and admits you don't see that type of "growth" today, as launching yourself on social media appears to be the norm. As previously reported by <a href=#>Stars Offline</a>, she is worth an impressive $1.3 million as of May 2020.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmbWlhbX12e9ahpmaho2K5orjAZqSipJGjfA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestD - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
