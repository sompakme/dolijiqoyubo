Myers and Cardona have had the opportunity to work together in IMPACT/TNA in the past.</p><p>While speaking to <a href=#>Sports Illustrated</a>, Myers acknowledged that it’s very likely for The Major Players to reunite in TNA because Matt Cardona has made a positive impression on several individuals in the promotion. He praised Cardona for his unique approach and success in the wrestling world, emphasizing that Cardona has numerous options and has won over many people in TNA.</p><p>“That’s always an option,” said Myers. “Matt is doing incredibly well doing what he’s doing, and he’s pretty much the only one in the world doing it the way he’s doing it at the level he’s doing it. He’s got a plethora of options, and he’s won a lot of people over at TNA, so that will always be an option.”</p><p>While the prospect of a Major Players reunion in TNA remains an option, Cardona has been clear about wanting to sign another wrestling contract, but only under terms that align with his career goals and preferences.</p><p>Do you think a reunion of The Major Players in TNA Wrestling would be exciting for fans?
