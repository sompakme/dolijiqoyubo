Johnson claimed that back in 1997, while attending Santa <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Monica</a> College, he worked as a stripper to help pay his bills. ‚ÄúI used to strip at The Right Track. I used to be a dancer. I could tell you cause we family. 1997, I was in LA. My mom was out there but I really couldn‚Äôt live with my mama, so I had a place in Santa Monica. Sometimes I was short on my light bill. Them candles, light em. I used to strip. I used to be a dancer.
