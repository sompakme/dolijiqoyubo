The charges come from a 2021 incident that allegedly took place outside of a hotel in Hollywood. He's accused of pointing a gun at his former childhood friend and collaborator ASAP Relli, shooting in his direction various times, and grazing his hand once.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Superior Court Judge Karla Kerlin determined that preliminary hearings will take place on June 28 and August 2 of this year, and the trial will officially begin on October 21. ASAP Rocky was not present in court when she made her decision. Kerlin's ruling comes after Judge ML Villar ruled that there is <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">sufficient evidence for the rapper to stand trial</a>, despite his attorneys pushing back.</p><span><h2 class="__className_a6f35b font-bold text-2xl lg:text-[2.125rem] mb-[18px] font-poppins leading-10" id=h-asap-rocky-s-trial-to-begin-on-october-21-2024>ASAP Rocky's Trial To Begin On October 21, 2024</h2></span><p>A$AP Rocky attends as Tiffany & Co. celebrates the debut of the Tiffany Titan by Pharrell Williams Collection at Tiffany & Co.

After the performer entered his not-guilty pleas earlier this year, his lawyer Joe Tacopina appeared confident in his ability to prove his client's innocence and indicated that they wouldn't be seeking a plea deal. "We’re going to try the case in the courtroom,” he told reporters at the time. “And when we do, <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">facts will come out that show that he’s truly innocent</a>. And that he’s a victim in this case."</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">What do you think of ASAP Rocky's <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">upcoming trial</a> getting an official start date at the end of October?
