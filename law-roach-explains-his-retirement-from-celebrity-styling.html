The iconic fashion stylist explained his reasoning during an interview with The Cut. Over the years, Roach has worked with many celebrities on looks including Zendaya, Celine Dion, Tom Holland, and <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Ariana Grande</a>.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">“I am definitely, 100,000 percent retiring," he told the outlet. "Nobody can say what’s forever and what will happen, but at this moment, and in my mind, I’m definitely retiring from celebrity styling. I’m not retiring from fashion, because I love it so much. But styling, in the way that I’ve been of service to other people, I’m retiring from that.”</p><span></span><p>NEW YORK, NEW YORK - MAY 16: Megan Thee Stallion and Law Roach onstage at the 26th Annual Webby Awards on May 16, 2022 in New York City.

I haven’t been happy, honestly, in a really long time. And the culmination of everything that’s been happening in my career these last few days kind of just pushed me over the edge. And it’s just like, You know what? I’ve done everything. I’m very grateful that I’ve been able to move and climb in this industry the way I have.”</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">While he says he's grateful for the success he's achieved, Roach admits it's come at the cost of great personal sacrifices. He continued: “But I can’t say that I didn’t do that without suffering. And I think as Black people in this country, it’s embedded in us to suffer, right? We feel like to be successful, we have to suffer. You suffer through things to get to the other side, you know? You suffer through Earth to get to heaven, you know what I mean?"</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">"I made that post because I felt like I couldn’t breathe and me releasing that and letting the world know that I’m done with this was the first time that whole week that I really felt like I took a breath, a deep breath,” he added. “I don’t wanna suffer no more, I don’t wanna be unhappy, I don’t wanna be at the beck and call of people and their teams." He further said: "I wanna take some time and figure out, you know, how to live.”</p><span><h2 class="__className_a6f35b font-bold text-2xl lg:text-[2.125rem] mb-[18px] font-poppins leading-10" id=h-law-roach-on-instagram>Law Roach On Instagram</h2></span><p>About The Author</p><p>Cole Blake is currently an Editor at HotNewHipHop based out of Brooklyn, New York.
