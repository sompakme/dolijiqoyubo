Despite meeting her future husband <a class=hm-link href=#>Pasha Kovalev</a> on the show back in 2013, the theme tune still triggers bad feelings.&nbsp;</p><p id=ec9z9on50w data-wc=33>During a candid chat on thepodcast with <a class=hm-link href=#>Sophie Ellis-Bextor</a>, who appeared in the same series, Rachel admitted that she struggled to watch professional dancer Pasha in the years that followed.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/7c034b4cad88-gettyimages-1398171741.jpg><p id=erLScJBtfG- data-wc=37>"It still gets me and it is ridiculous," she shared. "It does do something to your psyche that isn't comfortable. Even now like my body kind of like something's just like flowing through me that isn't comfortable.</p><p id=er_wxFhb8L data-wc=51>"I hate the theme tune and I have to put a brave face on with the girls and I'm like, 'Yay, daddy's on.' I mean I did get mild PTSD after it. I think the eventual way I learned to deal with it is to ignore it as much as possible."&nbsp;</p><p id=epccCptq-M data-wc=24>Rachel previously revealed she <a class=hm-link href=#>avoids watching the BBC show</a> after undergoing cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) to recover from her stint back ten years ago.&nbsp;</p><h4 class="relatedContentTitleClass_r14hzpr7 hm-heading">You may also like</h4><ul class=relatedContentListClass_ra09n5z><li class=relatedContentItemClass_r1rbqie4><a aria-label="Exclusive: Rachel Riley reveals how mini-me daughter is both like her mum and dad" class=hm-link href=# rel><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/square/e8b77dfa3083-rachel-riley-pasha-selfie-d.jpg></a><h5 class="miniCardTitle_m1w18s13 hm-heading"><a aria-label="Exclusive: Rachel Riley reveals how mini-me daughter is both like her mum and dad" class="miniCardLink_my4jhwq hm-link" href=# rel>Exclusive: Rachel Riley reveals how mini-me daughter is both like her mum and dad</a></h5><span class=miniCardLine_m1nt9q7p></span></li></ul><p id=eX13RHfSNA data-wc=46>She added: "I tried immersive, I tried ignoring it, I tried everything. The best way was to let it wash over me because obviously I was with Pasha. Every year, I'd find that I'd go through each week and I'd know exactly what week it was.&nbsp;</p><p id=e6eOdz90Ww data-wc=9><strong>Exclusive: <a class=hm-link href=#>Rachel Riley talks family life with Pasha Kovalev</a></strong></p><p id=elgDKazyqJ data-wc=40>"I'd have the memories of my experience on it, plus the memories of each year, and I'd like bring on everything that he was going through each week as well. So, it was compounding.

"Pasha got me a CBT session while I was on it because when I was in the dance off I just got stage fright and I came back the next week and I was just not there," she continued.&nbsp;</p><figure class=videoPlayerClass_v1tejlff>WATCH: Rachel Riley and Pasha Kovalev's family day out with adorable daughters</figure><p id=eIH3I_uwgz data-wc=40>"And he said, 'What's happened to you?' So he sent me for rapid CBT. And it was one of the most brilliant things I've done in my life because it taught me I was a perfectionist, which I didn't realise.&nbsp;</p><p id=e-s6CiTSst data-wc=71>"I thought being a perfectionist meant you wanted everything to be perfect, but it doesn't. It means whenever you do something you pick at the small things that go wrong rather than the CBT taught me to actually set a target before I do anything and then if you achieve that, look at that and be proud rather than look at the things that always go wrong and pick yourself apart."</p><p id=enwGA8SvFa data-wc=48>The couple started dating in 2014 after they were partnered together in the 2013 series of Strictly. They <a class=hm-link href=#>then married in June 2019</a> in Las Vegas, months before welcoming their first child, little Maven, on 15 December of that year. They have since welcomed another daughter called Noa.</p><h2 class="newsletterTitleClass_nlzr60o hm-heading">Sign up to HELLO Daily! for the best royal, celebrity and lifestyle coverage</h2><span class=newsletterDisclaimerClass_ncg5smk><p>By entering your details, you are agreeing to HELLO!
