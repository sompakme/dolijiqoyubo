The sapphire blue <span data-scayt_word=billywig data-scaytid=1>billywig</span> is rarely noticed by <span data-scayt_word=muggles data-scaytid=2>muggles</span> (aka <span data-scayt_word=non-wizarding data-scaytid=3>non-wizarding</span> kind). Even witches and wizards have trouble catching the Australian insect until they are stung. No wonder it's so difficult for Newt <span data-scayt_word=Scamander data-scaytid=4>Scamander</span> (Eddie <span data-scayt_word=Redmayne data-scaytid=5>Redmayne</span>) to catch this bugger! Side effects from a <span data-scayt_word=Billywig data-scaytid=6>Billywig</span> sting include levitation and giddiness. P.S. If you look closely, you'll notice its wings sit on top of its head, where they spin instead of flapping.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=0><h2>Bowtruckle</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/image006-embed.jpg><p>Warning: <span data-scayt_word=Bowtruckles data-scaytid=1>Bowtruckles</span> can be sassy and suffer from separation anxiety. Well, at least Newt's favorite beast "Pickett" can. These hand-sized insects have sharp fingers and typically live in trees used to create wands. The tree guardians are peaceful creatures but will turn aggressive if anyone or anything threatens its forest home. What's for lunch: the twig-like creatures munch on wood lice.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=0><h2>Demiguise</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/screen_shot_2016-12-16_at_2.42.44_pm.png><p>The <span data-scayt_word=demiguise data-scaytid=1>demiguise</span> is known for two very powerful properties: invisibility and predicting the future. Only well-trained witches and wizards can see them; one must engage in something completely unpredictable to find the ape-like creatures, otherwise they'll predict their capture. Fun fact: it's possible <span data-scayt_word=demiguise data-scaytid=2>demiguise</span> hair was used to make one of Harry Potter's most prized possessions: his invisibility cloak. <span data-scayt_word=Demiguise data-scaytid=19>Demiguise</span> hair pelts can be woven into them.&nbsp;</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=1.4654731457801><h2>Diricawl</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/screen_shot_2016-12-16_at_2.50.13_pm.png><p>The <span data-scayt_word=diricawl data-scaytid=1>diricawl</span> is a flightless bird with a funny secret. Within J.K. Rowling's universe, the <span data-scayt_word=diricawl data-scaytid=2>diricawl</span> is actually what <span data-scayt_word=muggles data-scaytid=3>muggles</span> call the dodo bird. Why? To escape from danger, the feathered creatures can disappear and reappear some place new. So <span data-scayt_word=muggles data-scaytid=4>muggles</span> think the birds have gone extinct, but they've actually just vanished from <span data-scayt_word=nonwizard data-scaytid=6>nonwizard</span> communities. Joke's on you, <span data-scayt_word=muggles data-scaytid=5>muggles</span>.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=0><h2>Doxy</h2><p>The <span data-scayt_word="Doxy's" data-scaytid=1>Doxy's</span> nickname is the Biting Fairy â€” and for good reason. One should take an antidote immediately if bitten by its venomous teeth. Look out for these pests in your draperies, too; the pests are known to infest homes. Your neighborly wizard recommendation: store a healthy supply of <span data-scayt_word=Doxycide data-scaytid=2>Doxycide</span> to keep the varmints far away.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=0.98282442748092><h2>Erumpant</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/fb-vfx-fs-01404-h_2016.jpg><p>Don't mess with <span data-scayt_word=erumpents data-scaytid=1>erumpents</span>. These rhinoceros-like creatures have thick hides that can <span data-scayt_word=repell data-scaytid=3>repell</span> most spells. And stay far away from their horns, which eject a deadly fluid that will make its victims explode. Unfortunately, there aren't too many <span data-scayt_word=erumpents data-scaytid=2>erumpents</span> in the <span data-scayt_word=Wizarding data-scaytid=4>Wizarding</span> World, because they often make themselves blow up during mating season. Yikes. Fun fact: you could have an <span data-scayt_word=erumpent data-scaytid=5>erumpent</span> as your <span data-scayt_word=Patronus data-scaytid=6>Patronus</span> (aka your spirit animal used during the <span data-scayt_word=Patronus data-scaytid=7>Patronus</span> Charm).</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=1.958041958042><h2>Fwooper & Graphorn</h2><p>See that fluttering pink bird above? That's a <span data-scayt_word=fwooper data-scaytid=1>fwooper</span>, an African bird known for its high-pitched song that will drive its listener insane. As a precaution, the magical creature can be sold, only if a Silencing Charm is placed on it.</p><p><span data-scayt_word=Graphorns data-scaytid=2>Graphorns</span> are beasts characterized by their thick skin (tougher than that of dragons) and their tentacle mouths. Fun fact: the horn can be used for special antidotes.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=0.98047722342733><h2>Niffler</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/image005-embed.jpg><p>The <span data-scayt_word=niffler data-scaytid=1>niffler</span> is an adorable platypus-like animal with a very expensive habit. The black-haired creature loves anything shiny, which means it can wreak havoc if it's in the vicinity of jewels, coins or treasures. Their tummies can serve as seemingly bottomless storage facilities, similar to the pouch Hermione Granger uses with an Undetectable Extension Charm in the original Harry Potter movies.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=0><h2>Nundu</h2><p>Hear the mighty <span data-scayt_word=nundu data-scaytid=1>nundu</span> roar! Well, don't stand too close. Talk about bad breath; the <span data-scayt_word="nundu's" data-scaytid=3>nundu's</span> breath is toxic and spreads disease. Remember when Harry Potter had to stun scary creatures during the <span data-scayt_word=Triwizard data-scaytid=4>Triwizard</span> Tournament (in Goblet of Fire)? That wouldn't be so simple if he came across one of these mammals. It takes about 100 witches or wizards to subdue the deadly <span data-scayt_word=nundu data-scaytid=2>nundu</span>.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=1.9628099173554><h2>Mooncalf</h2><p><img alt src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.hollywoodreporter.com/sites/default/files/custom/Aaron/FB_Mooncalf%20(1).gif style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>How cute are these mooncalves? If only they made more air time in 2016's Fantastic Beasts.&nbsp;</p><p>Actually, it makes sense why we don't see much of these animals in the film; The mooncalf is incredibly shy and only emerges from its burrow under a full moon. Fun fact: these beasts love to dance and can at times make geometric patterns in wheat fields, confusing <span data-scayt_word=muggles data-scaytid=1>muggles</span>&nbsp;to think they're made by UFOs. (In other words, J.K. Rowling makes a dig at crop circle theories.)</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=0.48984198645598><h2>Murtlap</h2><p>Feast your eyes on this odd, marine rat. The <span data-scayt_word=murtlap data-scaytid=1>murtlap</span>&nbsp;has a sea anemone for a back and bares a vicious bite. Fun fact: the growth on its back can be pickled and consumed for healing remedies. Don't eat too much though, or your ear hair could turn purple. P.S. Remember when <span data-scayt_word=Doloros data-scaytid=2>Doloros</span> <span data-scayt_word=Umbridge data-scaytid=3>Umbridge</span> cuts Harry Potter's hands in the Order of the Phoenix during his detention? Hermione Granger uses <span data-scayt_word=murtlap data-scaytid=14>murtlap</span>&nbsp;essence to heal his wounds.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=0.49038461538462><h2>Occamy</h2><p>Be very careful if you're caught in a large room with an <span data-scayt_word=occamy data-scaytid=1>occamy!</span>&nbsp;The serpentine-bodied creature will grow to fit available space, meaning it can stretch its body to every corner of a room or it can shrink itself to fit into a tiny tea cup. Its eggs are also incredibly valuable, as they're made of pure silver. That's why (SPOILER) Newt <span data-scayt_word=Scamander data-scaytid=3>Scamander</span> gives them to Kowalski to help finance his bakery. Fun fact: you could have an <span data-scayt_word=occamy data-scaytid=2>occamy</span> as your <span data-scayt_word=Patronus data-scaytid=4>Patronus</span>.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=0><h2>Swooping Evil</h2><p>Swoop there it is!&nbsp;</p><p>Think of the swooping evil as a cross between a reptile and a butterfly. But don't be fooled to think these beautifully-winged creatures are gentle. They can feed on people's brains and deflect spells by flying into their enemies' paths. One positive perk though is that their venom can be diluted to erase bad memories. Ignorance is bliss, right?</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=0.98320895522388><h2>Thunderbird</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.hollywoodreporter.com/sites/default/files/custom/Aaron/FB_Mooncalf%20(1).gif><p>Thunderbirds certainly live up to their names. The eagle-faced beasts can create storms as they fly by simply flapping their powerful wings. The avian creatures are native to Arizona, which is the main reason Newt <span data-scayt_word=Scamander data-scaytid=1>Scamander</span> wanted to travel to the United States in the first place after rescuing a Thunderbird named Frank. Unfortunately for him, many of his beasts escape from his magical trunk, a bittersweet treat allowing us to meet all of these majestic animals.</p></li></ul><h2 id=section-heading class="c-heading larva a-font-primary-xs lrv-u-text-transform-uppercase">THR Newsletters</h2><p class="c-tagline a-font-secondary-italic-s lrv-u-margin-a-00 lrv-u-margin-b-150@mobile-max">Sign up for THR news straight to your inbox every day</p><a class="c-button larva lrv-a-unstyle-button lrv-u-cursor-pointer lrv-u-padding-tb-075 lrv-u-padding-lr-150 lrv-u-border-color-brand-accent lrv-u-border-a-1 a-font-accent-bold-s lrv-u-text-transform-uppercase lrv-u-color-brand-accent u-margin-l-150@tablet" href=# rel><span class=c-button__inner>Subscribe</span> <span class=lrv-a-screen-reader-only>Sign Up</span></a> <a class="c-logo lrv-a-glue a-glue--t-n35 u-width-55 u-height-55 u-color-black" href=#><span class=lrv-a-screen-reader-only>Logo text</span></a><h2 id=section-heading class="c-heading larva a-font-primary-xs lrv-u-text-transform-uppercase">WEEKLY NEWSLETTER</h2><p class="c-tagline a-font-accent-s lrv-u-text-align-center">Get the scoops first!
