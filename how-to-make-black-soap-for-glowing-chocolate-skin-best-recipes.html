Do not use aluminium bowls because they can react with potash. Do not use tap water or mineralized drinking water because they all contain chemical elements, which can change the effect of the final result. Once the ingredients are mixed, place the bowl onto the fire and heat up until the potash boils. Now, collect your patience and boil the mixture for 30 minutes.</p><p class=align-left>In 30 minutes, the potash will start to form crumbles. It is when you should remove the bowl from the fire and let the substance cool down before using it further. Meanwhile, you need to set the oils in a deep pot over low heat to melt the coconut one. Make sure the pot is deep enough, and the oils will not boil over. The pot cannot be used for cooking afterwards, and it is very important!</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/vllkyt22g0iucg521g.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>DIY: How to make orange oil at home!</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Now, take about 70g of potash base and mix with 180ml of warm water. Please wait until it dissolves (5 to 10 minutes, as a rule). When done, pour it into the mixture of oils. Scrub the pot walls with a rubber spatula to get all the potash and waste not a drop. Stir thoroughly so that the mixtures blend perfectly.</p><p class=align-left>Now, keep on blending the mixture until it starts getting thick. When it does, you can remove the pot from the fire and add some essential oils or whatever else you would like to add. Many people prefer adding nothing and leaving the product as pure as it can be. Pour the mixture into moulds and leave while it gets solid. In 24 to 48 hours, take the bars out of the moulds and leave for two weeks. The bars must ripen.</p><h2>Usage rules</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/8d72809f940e19de.png><p class=align-left>After learning how to mix black soap, you will also need to know how to use it properly.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/vllkyt3cvjk4rsbo6.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>The most delicious chicken pie recipe ever</span></p></a><li>First of all, you need to remember that the product is quite scrubby and contains many particles that can greatly irritate your skin. That is why you should foam it first and only then work it upon your skin. It will provide the desired cleaning effect.</li><li>Of course, you can use it on coarse areas of your body, like heels, for example, but you definitely should avoid working it upon your face, neck or other sensitive areas.</li><li>Also, you should remember that the product can (and most likely will) give you a slight sensation of tingling or burning. It is a normal effect that should not frighten you. Nonetheless, if you notice irritation or rash, stop using this cosmetic product immediately.</li><li>Even though it will never be as hard as the cosmetic products, we are used to. Store it in a soap dish with a lot of holes that allow excess moisture to drain away.</li><h3>Can you use African black soap on your face everyday?</h3><p class=align-left>Although black soap is an excellent deep cleanser, it should not be used on a daily basis. It is advised to use it no more than two or three times per week.</p><p class=align-left>After the procedure, apply a good moisturizer that is appropriate for your skin type. If you already have dry, mature skin, it can make it even drier, especially during the winter months.</p><p class=align-left>If you have oily skin, it can also dry it out, causing it to overproduce sebum (oil), leading to breakouts. The skin on your body is more resilient than the skin on your face. It can withstand the more frequent application of the product.</p><p class=align-left>Now, you know how to mix black soap to keep your skin in good condition. If you made your first soap bar and noticed a white film over the surface of the bar, you should not worry. It is a normal thing that appears with time. It does not affect the quality of the product.</p><p class=align-left><strong>DISCLAIMER:</strong> This article is intended for general informational purposes only and does not address individual circumstances.
