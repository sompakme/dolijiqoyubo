Hopefully you will be fired soon."</p><p>Collins backtracked following the response, writing: "I’m sorry about the Blue Ivy tweet — bad joke, and black girls in particular deserve better."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/NINTCHDBPICT000551368901.jpg><p>However, his followers slammed the apology as "insincere" and "weak".</p><p>One wrote: "You have a lot of issues to work through, and a lot of people here absolutely do not have to accept this incredibly weak apology.</p><p>"Disgusting and it was the first day of a whole new decade."</p><p>Lucca's response to the backlash was also deemed "flippant", with the web editor tweeting: "Sorry I was cleaning my apartment while this blew up...

Sorry that I insulted Beyoncé’s daughter by suggesting that she might get plastic surgery some day, like many children of famous people do."</p><p>She continued: "We’ve been moved to the evil category and there’s no way for us to get out of it. I’m sure there will be plenty of people responding to this saying I’m playing the victim by pointing this out.</p><p>"There is nothing that I can say that won’t be written off or projected upon or dunked on, so I choose to say nothing.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/NINTCHDBPICT000386297185-e1578048398421.jpg> <span class=article__bc_video-caption>Beyonce and Jay Z's daughter Blue Ivy covers her eyes when she sees a sexy pic of her parents at gig</span><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most Read In TV & Showbiz</h2></p><p>"Structural racism is real.
