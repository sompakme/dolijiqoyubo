Lonzo Ball saying <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Nas</a>&nbsp;<a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">isn't real</a> hip-hop, which angered many an "old head" earlier this summer feels like just the tip of the iceberg. Now, <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Kodak Black</a> has joined in the fun, dragging <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Jay-Z</a>'s lyrics as a means to position rap's current sound as far better than its predecessors.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">In a new Instagram post, Kodak proceeds to make a comparison between 90's rap and now, cherry-picking some repetitive lyrics from Jay's song "Money, Cash, Hoes," which appeared on his classic 1998 album&nbsp;Vol 2 ... Hard Knock Life. Opposite that refrain are the lyrics from his 2016 joint "Can I," which itself is off an LP that deals heavily in nostalgic imagery, calling itself&nbsp;<a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Lil B</a>.I.G. Pac&nbsp;and fashioning the project's cover art as a tribute (or not) to The Notorious B.I.G's massively successful album&nbsp;Ready To Die.&nbsp;Check out a screengrab of the Instagram post below.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/urbanlinx.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/userfiles/82/22/192282_6dbedacc26c940d776f401d476ae2cde.jpg><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">In the caption, Kodak writes "Real Shit B Goin On .. None Of Dat Hopscotch Shit," clowning on the seemingly pedestrian lyrics that Hov offered up in that particular song, which also featured <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>DMX</a> on the cut. While Kodak may have at least somewhat of a point comparing the sections that he did, there are two fundamental holes in this theory. First, Jay-Z does more than just say the above-mentioned lyrics in his song - in fact, the prose get to a reasonably well-written place at one point. Below is an excerpt from the first verse of the song:</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">That's life's enigma, long as life's within us<br>We gonna sin a lot and pray that Christ forgive us<br>F**k it!<br>Ice the wrists and raise the price on these n***s<br>Y'all can't floss on my level!<br>I'll invite you all to get with us&nbsp;if your ball is glitter<br>When I go all the Harlem playas wall my picture</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Second, Jay-Z has a body of work that is spans over 20 years, while Kodak Black is still mostly trying to find his sweet spot musically. Perhaps not quite the fairest of comparisons overall, but what do you think? Does the "Roll in Peace" rapper have a point or no?
