He is one of the biggest stars in contemporary hip-hop, and with each album, he brings a new concept to the table. For instance, <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">with HARDSTONE PYSCHO,</a> he delivered a project centered around biker gang aesthetics. It's an interesting concept that has led to some incredible tracks.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">One of our favorites would be the track "Glock" which serves as a ballad of sorts on the album. It stars with some pitched-up vocal samples that set the tone for the rest of the song. Subsequently, Toliver comes in with some beautiful vocals of his own. It's here where we get the line "hold my Glock when I'm in the club" which becomes a rallying cry for the hook. The track is an example of Toliver's versatility, which is shown all throughout HARDSTONE PYSCHO's tracklist.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Let us know what you think of this brand-new Don Toliver track, in the comments section down below.
