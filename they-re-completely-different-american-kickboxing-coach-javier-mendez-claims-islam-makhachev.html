Though, these two fighters convey huge dissimilarities in so many staffs.&nbsp;</p><p>The two Dagestani lightweights have used a similar strategy in the octagon, with a physically intimidating, grappling-heavy style that frequently leads to them mauling opponents on the ground. ‚ÄòThe Eagle‚Äô also serves as Makhachev‚Äôs mentor and coach.&nbsp;</p><p>While their coach Mendez argues that although Makhachev and Nurmagomedov are not biologically related, they are nonetheless as close as brothers despite having very different personalities.&nbsp;</p><p>‚ÄúIslam doesn‚Äôt have taglines. He doesn‚Äôt have great lines that he says. Islam is not out there doing what Khabib does. They‚Äôre completely opposite. Islam‚Äôs an adventure-type guy‚Ä¶he loves horse riding, dirt riding, and things of that nature. They‚Äôre completely different and Islam has been 100% comfortable with his role and he‚Äôs never wanted to be Khabib,‚Äù Mendez stated.&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>Although Makhachev and Nurmagomedov have been frequently compared, it should come as no surprise that Mendez, who has spent considerable time with both fighters, has a deeper understanding than anyone else inside and outside the ring.</p><p>Considering the similarities, American Kickboxing Academy head coach Javier Mendez claims Makhachev has never felt obligated to live up to Nurmagomedov‚Äôs legacy, let alone that he was a clone.</p><p id=TK8CV8>‚Äú[Makhachev] never copied [Nurmagomedov] from the beginning and he never felt pressure from the beginning,‚Äù Mendez said during an interview. ‚ÄúIslam was Islam right from the get-go. He knew what he was going to do. He knew his path and he had an example in Khabib to follow, but he wasn‚Äôt following in Khabib‚Äôs footsteps. It was Islam‚Äôs footsteps. It was his own identity.‚Äù</p><p>Makhachev, with a 10-fight winning streak, has already been anticipated as a future champion before even taking on Oliveira in the UFC 280 main event on Saturday. Mendez noticed this about Makhachev the moment he stepped foot in his gym in San Jose, California.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>The fight you‚Äôve all been asking for üëÄ<a href=# rel=noopener>@CharlesDoBronxs</a> vs <a href=# rel=noopener>@MakhachevMMA</a> is set for the LW title üëë</p><p>[ <a href=# rel=noopener>#UFC280</a> | <a href=# rel=noopener>@VisitAbuDhabi</a> | <a href=# rel=noopener>@InAbuDhabi</a> | <a href=# rel=noopener>#InAbuDhabi</a> ] <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/GhqjbwZ0LM</a></p><p>‚Äî UFC (@ufc) <a href=# rel=noopener>July 16, 2022</a></p><p>While Makhachev has frequently been distinguished by his suffocating wrestling and devastating grappling attacks, Mendez promises that if they chose to unleash them at UFC 280, they will have a lot more weapons in their inventory.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tLzOq6usspmku2%2BvzqZmraCVrr%2BmecKopKmklamyrcWMnaCfnpWnsq%2FAjJqknqqZmK6vecqimqSan622r7OMnKaam5hit6LCyJ6pZqWVo7Gmxoyco5qhnah6qr%2FLmqRmpZGgtaKvx56tZpyfmsCvwIyhmK%2BdXaC1oq7Im6pmqJWnwLC6wKWgrbFdmbK0vMitnGabn6K9or7Am6OeZZaetKnAyKeeZqukrrmmew%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestD - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
