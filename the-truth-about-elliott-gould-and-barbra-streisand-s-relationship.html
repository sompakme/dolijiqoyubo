A year after they married, Streisand's career took off. And, in fact, she was white-hot. Her 1968 film "Funny Girl" was a smash, and she was all over the Billboard charts. (She's had <a href=#>11 No. 1 albums</a> to date.) While Gould was in huge films like "M*A*S*H," Streisand was elevated to the stratosphere. "The happiest memories I have of Barbra are when we were living together before we were married," he told Playboy (via the<a href=#>&nbsp;Independent</a>).</p><p dir=ltr>In his&nbsp;CBS Sunday Morning interview, Gould discussed his relationship with Streisand, saying they grew in different ways. "Well, Barbra asked me at one point ... she said, 'Why did we grow apart?' And I said my question would be, 'How could we have grown apart?'" Gould explained. "And the answer to that is that we didn't grow together and the reason for that was because she became more important than us."</p><p dir=ltr>Gould also grew tired of being called "Mr. Streisand." "It was difficult to be married to someone who was married to their success," he told the Independent. "I was very young, she was very young, and we went as far as we could together." Gould and Streisand divorced more than 50 years ago, but they had a good thing going for eight-plus years and remain close friends to this day.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmbWllaX53e9OhnGasoqrBqXnAm6aurF2aua21zq2rZp%2BfqrmlecCnm2aakaevs62MrKurnZmorq%2Bw0mapnqSRqbawutKhoKln</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestD - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
