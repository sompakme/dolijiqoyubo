As&nbsp;Dancehall Mag reports, earlier today (March 11th), the Jamaican singer dropped by&nbsp;The Breakfast Club, where she dished about the process behind her new project, pretty privilege, and her relationship status, among other things.</p><p>When chatting with host Angela Yee, Shenseea addressed&nbsp;<a href=# rel>rumours that she was romantically involved with London On Da Track</a> after photos of them holding hands at the Super Bowl surfaced online, clarifying that they're just friends and collaborators. "London is a cool dude to me. We have been working together making music."</p><p>Another famous face who the 25-year-old has been linked to is Canadian rapper <a href=# class=text-word rel>Drake</a>, who the internet even speculated got the dancehall singer pregnant a few months ago. Shenseea denied these rumours, saying that she and the father of one have "never even kissed, much less, for him to get [her] pregnant."</p><p>As for the identity of her new beau, the "Lick" hitmaker wants to keep that under wraps for the time being. "Nobody – and when I say nobody, I mean nobody – knows who I'm dating," she told Yee. "I don't care who y'all be seeing online, you don't know who I'm dating, that's a fact!"</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/urbanlinx.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/userfiles/79/55/535579_082c1b860581c5799a380912f11b2f61.jpg><p><h6>Charley Gallay/Getty Images</h6></p><p>"I’ve been working so hard, I’ve been so focused on my career.
