Between the memed-out beef with Drake, the high-profile relationship with Nicki Minaj, and the lengthy prison bid-- most recently, the news that he's, unfortunately, headed back-- there's been a lot of noise that's distracted from Meek Mill's actual music, which is a shame, because he's amassed a staggering catalog of great work.</p><p>About a decade into a mainstream run— with a further trove of music going back to his <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">early teenage years</a>— the Philly rapper has more than enough legitimately great music to cement him as one of the better lyricists out. The rich irony of Meek Mill being a punchline for some in recent years is that, in truth, he can rap circles around much of his competition— a frustrating fact&nbsp;that's been lost in much of the drama.</p><p>But beefs and other nonsense aside, Meek is a genuinely talented artist. A street rapper's street rapper, he&nbsp;has carried the Philadelphia torch for grit and realism when it comes to the description of his rise and what it took to get there. Armed with an intense, emphatic delivery, Meek has detailed the grim realities of life in Philly, often with a candor and honesty, that paints him a virtuoso storyteller.</p><p>With a fantastic ear for beats, and an expertly curated selection of features,&nbsp;Meek also knows how to make a hit. Hs catalog is laden with huge songs that have made him a radio mainstay, and when you combine that with a lyrical ability that even the most curmudgeonly rap aficionados&nbsp;can appreciate, you end up with one of the more complete artists out.</p><p>Able to put his name to several classic mixtapes, and with a solid run of studio albums to boot, Meek Mill can assemble a highlight reel that few in his class can match. When you cull the standouts from his diverse oeuvre, you get a list of songs whose makeup defines their creator: earnest, wholehearted, and triumphantly loud.</p><p>These are the top 25 Meek Mill tracks.</p><p><br><h2>Racked Up Shawty feat. Fabolous and French Montana</h2></p><p>Top 25 Best Meek Mill Songs Of All Time</p><p>With a hulking, bassline-addled instrumental from now-household name Southside, 2012's "Racked Up Shawty" finds Meek calling on the services on fellow elite flexers Fabolous and French Montana to get his point across. Loudly announcing "Nigga I'm racked up and I'm racked out,&nbsp;fuck a bitch 'til she tap out /&nbsp;Fuck a bitch then I pass out,&nbsp;and my pockets on J. Stackhouse," Meek once again separates himself from the competition. With effective verses from both Fab and French, "Racked Up Shawty" is another towering track on the classic Dreamchasers 2 mixtape.</p><p></p><p><h2>Lil Nigga Snupe</h2></p><p>Top 25 Best Meek Mill Songs Of All Time</p><p>"Lil Nigga Snupe" is more than just one of the more heartfelt moments in Meek Mill's catalog—it also serves as a highpoint in his dexterity as a lyricist and songwriter.&nbsp;Offered as an earnest tribute to his fallen protege <a href=# class=text-word rel>Lil Snupe</a>, the Boi-1da produced track shows the very real pain Meek felt from the loss of a friend: "They killed my lil nigga Snupe, my lil nigga was the truth / And all he wanted was a coupe, all he wanted was a coupe / So what's a nigga 'sposed to do? / Tell 'em put the guns down or tell lil nigga shoot?"</p><p>While Meek's patented abrasive delivery lends itself well to braggadocio, it's also effective when it comes to relaying the anger and frustration that comes with prematurely losing someone close to you.</p><p></p><p><h2>Rose Red</h2></p><p>Top 25 Best Meek Mill Songs Of All Time</p><p>"Rose Red" is another early Meek Mill banger from the 2010 Flamers 3 mixtape.&nbsp;The Philly rapper shows out on "Rose Red," proudly displaying his rapid fire delivery over yet another fire beat from Jahil Beats. The uptempo, surging track matches Meek's skill set perfectly, as he's able to casually riddle off complicated bars: "When I tell her suck my dick I say make sure you do it sloppy / She said copy she got me say need me say prolly / Keep Louie on my body zoomies on that Mazarati / With that toolie on the side me try to do me you get bodied." Another testament to how Meek Mill has been consistently great at rapping for nearly a decade, "Rose Red" is an early highlight in a storied career.</p><p></p><p><h2>Jump Out the Face feat. Future</h2></p><p>Top 25 Best Meek Mill Songs Of All Time</p><p>"Jump Out the Face" is a standout track from Meek's 2015 album Dreams Worth More Than Money.&nbsp;Featuring a verse and a hook from Future, both rappers float over what is probably one of Metro Boomin's more under appreciated beats. "Jump Out the Face" sees Meek riding high at a time when he truly was—&nbsp;Dreams Worth More Than Money was one of the most anticipated albums of 2015, and for the most part it delivered— and Future, fresh off of DS2, was also cresting his own wave of success. "Jump Out the Face" more than captures the spirit of two titans at the top of their game.&nbsp;</p><p><h2>Burn feat. Big Sean</h2></p><p>Top 25 Best Meek Mill Songs Of All Time</p><p>A good rule of thumb for Meek Mill: if you hear a siren on the track, chances are it's gonna be fire. "Burn," from 2012's Dreamchasers 2, is not an exception to this rule. Featuring Big Sean— who actually has a surprisingly great chemistry with Meek Mill— "Burn" is blessed with an as-usual-dope&nbsp;instrumental from Jahlil Beats, and the two rappers trade solid verses for three and a half minutes. Though it's roughly five years old now, "Burn" has held up incredibly well.</p><p></p><p><h2>Indian Bounce</h2></p><p>Top 25 Best Meek Mill Songs Of All Time</p><p>2010's "Indian Bounce" was an early flash of promise for Meek's potential mainstream success. With a Jahlil Beats instrumental that seems to glance at an early 00's <a href=# class=text-word rel>Timbaland</a> sound, "Indian Bounce" is a catchy enough track that poised a relatively-rookie Meek Mill for larger things. Even in 2010, Meek was separating himself from the pack: "Clearly pal, this Philly in its flesh /&nbsp;I ain’t never get a tat but I got Philly on my back / I put castle in my back, I put Gillie on that track / And bring that real shit to the front, all that dissing to the back." "Indian Bounce" is definitely a gem in Meek's earlier work.</p><p></p><p><h2>Levels</h2></p><p>Top 25 Best Meek Mill Songs Of All Time</p><p>Before the phrase "It's levels to this shit" permeated the internet as a meme, it was a mantra repeated throughout Meek Mill's Dreamchasers 3 single "Levels." Produced by Cardo, 2013's "Levels" is vintage Meek—a swaggering, assertive track that gleefully details the different strata of wealth and success (hint: you and Meek aren't on the same one). Effectively proclaiming, "We don't rock the same clothes / Fuck the same hoes, ‘cause it's levels to this shit," Meek makes it clear just where he's at on this track.&nbsp;</p><p></p><p><h2>Check</h2></p><p>Top 25 Best Meek Mill Songs Of All Time</p><p>Another standout from 2015's massive Dreams Worth More Than Money, "Check" is Meek in top form— celebrating his success without a shred of humility. Produced by Metro Boomin and Southside— two beat makers who've complimented Meek well over the years— "Check" leaves no illusions about Meek's position as he effortlessly floats over the track's haunting synths and snares. Right from the opening line of the first verse when Meek snarls, "Look at all these young niggas flexing from the bottom / Jumping out them Raris, nigga do we have a problem?" we're instantly reminded of why he's remained such a dominant force in street rap.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><h2>Monster</h2></p><p>Top 25 Best Meek Mill Songs Of All Time</p><p>Meek dropped "Monster" in early 2015, fresh off his release from spending five months in a Philadelphia prison. The track shows an urgency that befits a man who had been waiting for nearly half a year to re-cement his position in the street rap hierarchy. Bringing an enthusiastic energy to the frantic Jahlil Beats instrumental, Meek picks up where he left off without missing a step: "Baddest bitch in the game wearing my chain, I'm ready /&nbsp;Switching lanes in that Mulsanne like I'm Andretti /&nbsp;I do the Balmain, Balenciaga, no Giuseppe / If they sleep on Meek Milly I kill these niggas like I was Freddy."</p><p><h2>Litty feat. Tory Lanez</h2></p><p>Top 25 Best Meek Mill Songs Of All Time</p><p>Tory Lanez&nbsp;and Meek Mill have teamed up on a few&nbsp;songs over the years, but the true standout among their collaborations is "Litty," a track from Meek's 2016 mixtape Dreamchasers 4. With a looming, bass-drenched beat by Sound M.O.B. serving as the backdrop, Meek casually flexes about the perks of his success and the perils of his haters. Bookending Meek's verse is an effective hook from Toronto rapper Tory Lanez, who also provides a solid verse of his own to the track, which is a definite highlight on DC4.</p><p></p><p><h2>Gave Em Hope</h2></p><p>Top 25 Best Meek Mill Songs Of All Time</p><p>"Gave Em Hope" is a three and half minute aural assault in which Meek raps his ass off on subjects ranging from his own come-up to clowning 50 Cent's Instagram. Released as the third track from 2016's 4/4 EP, "Gave Em Hope" features an exultant beat by C-Sick that's loud and assertive enough to match Meek's urgency. Over the course of the song Meek leaves very little doubt that he emerged from a turbulent 2015 no worse for wear, and still a cut above most of the competition lyrically.</p><p></p><p><h2>Ham Music</h2></p><p>Top 25 Best Meek Mill Songs Of All Time</p><p>"Ham Music" is an older gem from Meek's oeuvre, but it still holds up today as a showcase for his lyrical prowess. Taken from his 2011 mixtape Mr. Philadelphia 2, "Ham Music" is a great early example of Meek's chemistry with producer Jahlil Beats, as the relatively simple uptempo track is peppered with Beats' signature hostile snares— a fitting sonic complement to Meek's fevered delivery. "Ham Music" definitely displays the bars of a rapper about to blow— "Your chick my chick, my chick your chick / My swag fly shit, your swag, Norbit"— and it's worth revisiting as a testament to Meek's consistency.</p><p></p><p><h2>Connect the Dots</h2></p><p>Top 25 Best Meek Mill Songs Of All Time</p><p>"Connect the Dots" is a hard-hitting track from Wins & Losses that definitely evokes a golden era of MMG music. Featuring <a href=# class=text-word rel>Rick Ross</a> and Yo Gotti, the beat by Papamitrou provides a familiar setting, triumphant horns, bruising bass, for the three rappers to detail their ascension from the streets. It's an all-star lineup, and Meek, for his part, is anything but overshadowed: "Brand new Glock .40 with a ladder in that bitch (okay) / 32 deep so it don't matter who you get (no way) / All my niggas hittin', it don't matter who you with (okay) / We gon' whack you if you tellin', it don't matter if you snitch."&nbsp;</p><p><h2>R.I.C.O. feat. Drake</h2></p><p>Top 25 Best Meek Mill Songs Of All Time</p><p>"R.I.C.O." is a track&nbsp;featuring Drake that the world got to enjoy for about five minutes before the two started their extremely public feud. In fact, Meek tweeting that Drake didn't write his verse on "R.I.C.O." was one of the early provocations in their longstanding beef, giving the song a different sort of significance. Regardless, it's a shame, because "R.I.C.O." remains a banger that illustrates the strong chemistry the two rappers share in their tragically few collaborations. Over a pulsing, string-sample beat by Vinylz, Meek and Drake both deliver stellar verses&nbsp;on "R.I.C.O.", the third single from 2015's Dreams Worth More Than Money,&nbsp;which, beef aside, is still a highlight of Meek's catalog.</p><p><h2>1942 Flows</h2></p><p>Top 25 Best Meek Mill Songs Of All Time</p><p>"1942 Flows" is a marquee track from 2017's Wins & Losses that shows Meek in one of his pure strengths: rapping for about five minutes straight. Over a soulful, spare beat by Dougie, Meek gets introspective about where he's at— the success, the high-profile relationship, and the beef with Drake all get touched on in some regard. "1942 Flows" is simple, effective, and a good reminder that without flashy features Meek can still body a track on his own in four verses: "Talking, this my cocky flow / Damn Daniel, why you son him, Mr Miyagi though / This that rose gold Patek, call me like '94."</p><p>Top 25 Best Meek Mill Songs Of All Time</p><p>From 2016's Dreamchasers 4, "Offended" sees Meek&nbsp;joined by two of the hottest rappers in the game in Young Thug and 21 Savage over a bouncing, piano-driven track. Meek has historically had a great ear for beats and features, and "Offended" is no exception. All three rappers compliment the beat by CuBeatz, Murda Beatz, and OZ effectively, as Thugger adds his trademark crooning hook to round it out. "Offended" is definitely one of the more enduring tracks from Meek's fourth Dreamchasers tape.</p><p></p><p><h2>House Party</h2></p><p>Top 25 Best Meek Mill Songs Of All Time</p><p>Another gem from&nbsp;the landmark Dreamchasers mixtape, "House Party" captures Meek at his frenetic best as he unloads over a booming track by the Beat Bully. With an assist from fellow Philly stalwart <a href=# class=text-word rel>Young Chris</a>, Meek thoroughly goes in: "I fuck bitches by the group, I get money by the pound / French Montana on all these niggas ch-ch-ch-ch-chop em down / Every time I’m in the club these niggas is not around / Everybody talking money I say prove it—not a sound"</p><p><h2>War Pain</h2></p><p>Top 25 Best Meek Mill Songs Of All Time</p><p>Lost in all of the memes and social media&nbsp;shit talking that took place during&nbsp;his 2015 beef with Drake, was the fact that Meek Mill is actually good at rapping. "War Pain" was dropped just 15 minutes after Drake put out his middling "Summer Sixteen," and over a beat that's almost reminiscent of "The Takeover," Meek doesn't hold much back with the facts: "See an OVO chain, probably take that shit / Said dreamin' wasn't enough, we had to chase that shit / You ain't write it' nigga, we caught ya, can't erase that shit / And you claimin' you HOV now? Why you state that shit?"</p><p></p><p><h2>Tupac Back feat. Rick Ross</h2></p><p>Top 25 Best Meek Mill Songs Of All Time</p><p>"Tupac Back" is a staple of the entire MMG catalog at this point, and when it was released in 2011 it was huge. Produced by Mike Will Made-It, "Tupac Back" is a direct homage to the fallen rapper, as Meek and his MMG boss Rick Ross proclaim that they'll be carrying the torch for the&nbsp;rap legend. Serving as the lead single from the MMG compilation Self Made Vol. 1, "Tupac Back" is a wall of sound, a perfect backdrop for the emphatic Meek Mill: "Huh, Tupac back, I’m 2 Glocks strapped / Rolling down in Philly this the new Iraq."</p><p><h2>B Boy feat. Big Sean and A$AP Ferg</h2></p><p>Top 25 Best Meek Mill Songs Of All Time</p><p>"B Boy" dropped in 2015 as a part of MMG's NYC All-Star 15 tape, and unfortunately as a single it kind of came and went. It's a sadly overlooked track, because over an absurdly bass-heavy beat by Sap, Meek is once again at his best: "I been on that trill shit, way back / North Philly nigga, but I'm laid back / Get shot in your head drivin' your Maybach / Homey the Clown, know I don't play that." Meek is also joined by Big Sean and A$AP Ferg who both deliver solid verses, making "B Boy" a track that's definitely worth re-visiting.</p><p></p><p><h2>Tony Story</h2></p><p>Top 25 Best Meek Mill Songs Of All Time</p><p>Meek Mill's "Tony Story" is a sprawling saga that would wind up playing out over three parts, but the initial installment from&nbsp;the 2011 Dreamchasers&nbsp;mixtape still hits with the same impact it did when it was released. A cautionary tale of friends turning on each other for profit— and a family member's ensuing revenge— "Tony Story" displays Meek's considerable talent as a storyteller. Over an atmospheric track&nbsp;by Jahlil Beats, Meek aptly delivers&nbsp;a well-crafted&nbsp;arc that&nbsp;he would eventually <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">turn into a novel</a>: "Tony killed his own man Ty for a whole brick / Lined him all up and gave him the whole clip / Said he wasn't eatin', he wanted his own shit / And not to mention Ty was fuckin' his old bitch."</p><p></p><p><h2>Amen feat. Drake and Jeremih</h2></p><p>Top 25 Best Meek Mill Songs Of All Time</p><p>Serving as the lead single from Meek's debut studio album Dreams and Nightmares, 2012's "Amen" is one of just two tracks he and Drake made together before their well-publicized 2015 beef. Featuring a piano riff that creates a gospel feel worthy of the song's title, "Amen" found Meek&nbsp;<a href=# rel>drawing the ire of some in the Christian community</a> due to the track's hedonistic lyrical content. Controversy aside, it's an incredibly catchy song with Jeremih providing backing vocals, and Drake offers a memorable enough verse to make you wish they would dead the beef for good.</p><p></p><p><h2>Ima Boss feat. Rick Ross</h2></p><p>Top 25 Best Meek Mill Songs Of All Time</p><p>2011's "Ima Boss" is a hulking, statement track produced by Jahlil Beats, a beatmaker who has made a formidable pairing with Meek Mill over the years. The song's horns give it a sheen that compliments a surging baseline, and Meek goes in accordingly: "Thank god, all these bottles I popped / All this paper I been gettin, all these models I popped / I done sold 100,000 before my album got dropped." "Ima Boss" fittingly adds MMG captain Rozay to what was a standout track on the first Dreamchasers tape.&nbsp;</p><p><h2>Dreams and Nightmares Intro</h2></p><p>Top 25 Best Meek Mill Songs Of All Time</p><p>Arguably one of the best intros of the past decade (if not beyond), the lead-off track to Meek's debut studio album Dreams and Nightmares is a two-part&nbsp;masterclass in rapping. Deftly capturing the textures&nbsp;of the title's binary feelings, the "Dreams" portion of the track finds meek flexing on his elevated position in the rap landscape: "When I bought the Rolls-Royce they thought it was leased / Then I bought the new Ferrari—hater, rest in peace." When the beat changes, however, Meek assumes "Nightmare" mode and fires off the ferocious bars that aided in his initial rise, showing teeth that haven't dulled with success: "They gon' remember me, I say remember me / So much money have your friends turn into enemies / And when there's beef I turn my enemies to memories / With them bricks they go from 40—ain't no 10-a-key."</p><p><h2>In My Bag</h2></p><p>Top 25 Best Meek Mill Songs Of All Time</p><p>One of the catchier tracks on Meek's 2008 mixtape Flamers, "In My Bag" correctly portended the Philly rapper's hit-making potential. Over a pulsing, radio-friendly track by a then-unknown Sap, Meek offers a simple, effective hook between his trademark fits of fervent bars. Though he had been putting in work for years, "In My Bag" certainly played a role in Meek's ascension to the mainstream, as he blew up considerably in the months after its release. As the story goes, "In My Bag" led T.I. to sign Meek to Grand Hustle— his first record deal— and though he left the Atlanta rapper's imprint a few years later, it certainly put him on the path to success.</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvTp5ywoJmltbC8jZympmdhZX56f5Fmq6ioXWeCbq7ErKtmpZWauG65yKWjZqufo7S0ec6fZJqknGLBqrnEZqWer6M%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestD - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
