Blues</h3><span></span><p data-sourcepos=7:1-7:93><span>It all went down in 1989,</span><span> folks.</span><span> The Loma Prieta earthquake rumbled through the Bay Area,</span><span> and let's just say,</span><span> things got a little </span><strong>sideways</strong><span>.</span><span> While the iconic Golden Gate Bridge held its own (probably because it had seen enough fog to handle a little shaking),</span><span> its neighbor,</span><span> the </span><strong>San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge</strong><span>,</span><span> wasn't so lucky.</span></p><span></span><p data-sourcepos=9:1-9:151><span>Imagine cruising along,</span><span> enjoying the view,</span><span> when suddenly,</span><span> </span><strong>BAM!</strong><span> A 50-foot chunk of the upper deck decides it's redecorating the bay with a whole new meaning of "suspension.</span><span>" Luckily,</span><span> only one person was tragically killed,</span><span> but the bridge?</span><span> Let's

Viaduct</strong><span> on Interstate 880 also decided to do the "implosion" thing,</span><span> and that's where the real tragedy struck.</span><span> This collapse caused the most earthquake-related deaths.</span><span> So,</span><span> remember folks,</span><span> not all bridges are created equal,</span><span> especially when it comes to earthquake parties.</span></p><span></span><h3
