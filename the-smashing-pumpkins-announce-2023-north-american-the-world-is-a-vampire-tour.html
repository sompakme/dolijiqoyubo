That’s what The World Is A Vampire is about. Bringing back that sense of community. If you don’t fit in, you belong here. It’s about having a shared experience and respecting others, but ultimately having fun. A true alternative festival, where all the self-proclaimed weirdos and outsiders of the world can get together and have a party” – <strong>Billy Corgan</strong>&nbsp;</p><p>Along with news of their upcoming tour, the band released their brand-new single <strong>Spellbinding </strong>which received its radio debut this morning during a very special live appearance on <strong>The Howard Stern Show,</strong> revealing details of their upcoming tour and the release date for their highly anticipated third and final act of <strong>ATUM</strong>, which is set for release on <strong>May 5</strong>. <strong>Act 3</strong> will come with a special edition boxset featuring all 33 album tracks plus 10 additional unreleased songs, and is available for pre-order <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#><strong>HERE.</strong></a>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>The band performed ‘<strong>1979’</strong> and ‘<strong>EMPIRES’ </strong>live in the studio.

To learn more, click <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>HERE.</strong></a>&nbsp;</p><p>When <strong>The Smashing Pumpkins</strong> first emerged out of Chicago in 1988, the world had never heard a band quite like them. They spun together rock, pop, shoe-gaze, metal, goth, psychedelia, and electronic into a kaleidoscope of saccharine melodies, fuzzy distortion, bombastic orchestration, incendiary fretwork, eloquent songcraft, and unshakable hooks. Upon their formation, their sound was different, iconoclastic, and wholly new—and it still is today. As a result, they’ve sold over 30 million albums worldwide and collected two GRAMMY® Awards, two MTV VMAs, and an American Music Award. Their catalog is highlighted by the platinum <strong>Gish</strong> [1991], the quadruple-platinum <strong>Siamese Dream</strong> [1993], diamond-certified <strong>Mellon Collie</strong> and the <strong>Infinite Sadness</strong> [1995], platinum <strong>Adore</strong> [1998], and gold <strong>Machina/The Machines of God</strong> [2000]. In 2018, they embarked on one of their most successful tours ever, the <strong>Shiny and Oh So Bright Tour</strong>, followed by <strong>SHINY AND OH SO BRIGHT, VOL. 1 / LP: NO PAST. NO FUTURE. NO SUN.</strong> Meanwhile, 2020 saw the release of the band’s eleventh full-length and latest double album, <strong>CYR</strong>. As prolific as ever, <strong>The Smashing Pumpkins</strong> are currently working on new music. More details to come.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.livenationentertainment.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Static_Social-FacebookPR_1200x630_TheSmashingPumpkins_2023_National.jpg><p style=text-align:center>&nbsp;<br><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">OFFICIAL WEBSITE</a><strong> | </strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">FACEBOOK</a><strong> | </strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">TWITTER</a><strong> | </strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">INSTAGRAM</a><strong> | </strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">YOUTUBE</a>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Live Nation Entertainment</strong>&nbsp;<br>Live Nation Entertainment (NYSE: LYV) is the world’s leading live entertainment company comprised of global market leaders: Ticketmaster, Live Nation Concerts, and Live Nation Sponsorship.

Originally founded in 1948, the NWA has been a cornerstone of professional wrestling on a global scale for generations as a promotion and a governing body. Under Corgan’s leadership, the NWA is reaching new heights in the sport and is growing an international fan base. Featured talents include NWA Women’s World Champion Kamille, NWA World Tag Team Champions Bestia 666 & Mecha Wolf, NWA World Junior Heavyweight Champion Kerry Morton, Trevor Murdoch, Natalia Markova, Chris Adonis, Thom Latimer, EC3, Thrillbilly Silas Mason, Odinson, Mercurio, Kenzie Paige, Missa Kate, and many more. Be a part of the action as NWA titles and reputations will be on the line in this unique concert environment unlike any other. <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">https://www.nationalwrestlingalliance.com</a>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Interpol&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;</p><p>Interpol began in New York in 1997, when guitarist Daniel Kessler recruited bassist Carlos Dengler and singer/guitarist Paul Banks to form a band. In 2002, with Sam Fogarino on drums, the band signed to Matador records and released Turn On The Bright Lights, which made it to 10th position on NME’s list of 2002’s top releases and Pitchfork named it the year’s #1 album. Over the next two decades would go on to wide critical and commercial acclaim, with six subsequent high charting records on the Billboard 200; earning rave reviews across the map from Rolling Stone to TIME; performing on late night television shows including the Late Late show with David Letterman and Conan and playing major festivals like Coachella and Glastonbury and headlining Mexico’s Corona Capital. The band (Banks, Kessler and Fogarino) released their 7th album, “The Other Side Of Make-Believe”, in July 2022 to critical acclaim. MOJO called the album “quietly masterful”, Clash hailed it as “some of the boldest, most uncompromising work of their career”, and NME described it as “a confident, rewarding and subtly adventurous new chapter”. They’re touring across the globe in 2023.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Rival Sons</strong>&nbsp;</p><p>Rival Sons play rock ‘n’ roll in its purest form without apology or pretense. Instead, they simply plug in, turn up, and rip on a path of their own. Along the way, they’ve architected a critically acclaimed catalog, including Pressure & Time [2011], Head Down [2012], Great Western Valkyrie [2014], Hollow Bones [2016], and FERAL ROOTS [2019]. The latter represented a creative and critical high watermark, scoring a pair of GRAMMY® Award nominations in the categories of “Best Rock Album” and “Best Rock Performance” for the single “Too Bad.” Elevating the band to another level, “Do Your Worst” vaulted to #1 at Rock Radio as their biggest hit to date, tallying north of 60 million streams and counting. Speaking to their impact, Rolling Stone attested, “Rival Sons have done their part to introduce new fans to rock.” Beyond sharing stages with everyone from Black Sabbath, The Rolling Stones, and AC/DC to Guns N’ Roses and Lenny Kravitz, they’ve ignited television shows such as The Late Late Show with James Corden. During 2021, they launched their own label Sacred Tongue Recordings distributed by Thirty Tigers and celebrated the tenth anniversary of Pressure & Time by performing the album in its entirety on tour. Ultimately, Rival Sons aren’t here to tell you exactly what to think or what to feel, but they’ll give you one hell of a ride if you let them. That ride twists and turns like never before on their 2023 seventh full-length LP, DARKFIGHTER [Low Country Sound / Atlantic Records] kickstarted by the single “Nobody Wants to Die.” <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">https://www.rivalsons.com</a>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Stone Temple Pilots</strong>&nbsp;</p><p>With over 70 million albums sold, Stone Temple Pilots roared on to the scene in 1992 with their raucous debut, Core. A breakout success, the album peaked #3 on the Billboard 200 chart, and dominated radio waves with hits like “Sex Type Thing,” “Wicked Garden,” and the Grammy-Award winning smash single, “Plush.” STP quickly distinguished themselves as a band beholden to no trend. Boasting the inimitable riffs of guitarist Dean DeLeo, the propulsive rhythm section of bassist Robert DeLeo and drummer Eric Kretz, and the charismatic baritone of frontman Scott Weiland, STP ruled airways, video playlists and charts alike over their legendary career. The band released their latest studio album, Perdida in 2020 with new lead singer, Jeff Gutt. Paste magazine described Perdida as the most sonically rich experience that Stone Temple Pilots have offered fans to date. <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">www.stonetemplepilots.com</a>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>For all media inquiries, please contact:</strong>&nbsp;</p><p>Alexandra Baker | <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener"><span class=__cf_email__ data-cfemail=e7a68b829f8689839586a78f8e808f958e94829795c984888a>[email&nbsp;protected]</span></a>&nbsp;</p><p>Jamie Sward | <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener"><span class=__cf_email__ data-cfemail=ce84afa3a7ab8ea6a7a9a6bca7bdabbebce0ada1a3>[email&nbsp;protected]</span></a>&nbsp;</p><h4>Read more about</h4><a class=post-tag href=#>Concerts</a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rbXVnqWarJmku6a6056prZmZo7qmutNnmqilX2d9c3%2BOaWporJiaerS5wKyfoqaXYr22uc%2BkoKerXZa7r7vUp5qeZWJlf3R5zaipraBdlrqmvsicmKdlpJ2ybsPOq6OdZZmoeqJ51ZqkqaGimnq1u9SrZg%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestD - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
