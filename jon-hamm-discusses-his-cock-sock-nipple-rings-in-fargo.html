It’s not pleasant. None of it’s pleasant.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">Kimmel mused, “What do they call that? There’s a name for it.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">“They call it a cock sock, Jimmy,” Hamm replied.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">“And that is something that you affix yourself?” Kimmel wondered. “Or is there a cock sock handler.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">“If there is, I did not use one,” Hamm explained. “I was hands on for that … [it’s cinched on] tight enough, tight enough so it’s not going anywhere.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">Kimmel also asked about <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Hamm’s character’s nipple rings</a>, which might seem a bit incongruent with his hard boiled cowboy character.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">“They were real nipple rings pierced through fake nipples,” Hamm said, while sharing a picture from the makeup chair. “Magic doesn’t happen by itself, Jimmy.” (“They have to paint some latex on your nipples and then they pull it off and then they put a little fake nipple and put a ring through it. It’s the magic of movies. You too can have fake nipples made,” <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>the Morning Show star previously shared</a>. It should be noted, he also <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>stripped down for the Apple series this season</a>.)</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">As showunner <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>Noah Hawley previously explained to The Hollywood Reporter</a>, the Fargo series creator and showrunner&nbsp;came up with the accessory for the character, explaining “we live in&nbsp;Tiger King&nbsp;America, right — there’s a hedonism to the Christian Right that is unexpected, let’s just put it that way. And I thought it would dimensionalize Jon more than he’s just some sheriff who thumps the Bible.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube"><p><span class=embed-youtube></span></p></figure><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">Fargo airs weekly on FX, with its 10 episodes streaming on Hulu the next day. The latest installment stars&nbsp;<a href=#>Juno Temple</a>&nbsp;(Ted Lasso) leading as a seemingly typical Midwestern housewife who is suddenly plunged back into a life she thought she had left behind.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m"><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>Hawley had shared his inspiration for this season with THR</a>, which stems from the Fargo movie.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">“I went back to the original film, and it’s such a compelling moral dilemma story, and the characters are so great, but I found myself focused on Bill Macy’s wife. It was such a great performance, but once the bag went over her head, that was it for her. I thought, ‘What if the bag never goes over the head? What if she’s not kidnappable and there’s a backstory there?'” he said, ahead of the season’s launch.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">“It opened me up to explore this concept of ‘the wife.’&nbsp;I found this great&nbsp;New York Magazine&nbsp;piece from the 1970s where this woman wrote this essay called, ‘I Want a Wife.’ She wrote about all the things that she wanted a wife to do for her. I thought that was really fun to play with, as well. And I thought that given that every year the show, for me, is primarily female in identity, because the movie was Marge’s story, when you think about it, that would be a really powerful place to land.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvLpbCwp5%2BZv6a8zqurnqpemLyue9OvZq2uXaOyuL%2BOo6anZZiWuq55wqiapGWjpLCsec2ip6mklWK%2FqrrGrGSfmaKcvG59kWxsb3FnboF5ew%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestD - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
