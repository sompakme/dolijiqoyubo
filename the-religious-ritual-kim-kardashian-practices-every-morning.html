"We start our day with a group chat with a Bible verse from my mom, and everyone chimes in on the meaning of it. We are very Christian—and our work ethic and our discipline comes from so many years at Catholic school.”</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_5-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Kevin Mazur/MG18</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_6-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Surprised? Don't be. The Kardashians have spoken about being religious before. Kim's younger sis Khloé even wrote about it at length in <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>a 2016 Lenny Letter</a>, poking fun at the fact that some people might not predict their actual level of religious devotion.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_8-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"When you think Kardashian, devout probably isn't the first thing that crosses your mind. Believe it or not, I come from a very religious family," she wrote.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_10-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Khloé went on to explain that her dad Robert Kardashian was Christian Armenian, and she always went to Presbyterian or Catholic schools.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_12-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"We went to church every Sunday, religiously," she wrote. "When we started getting older, my dad stopped going to church, but he still read the Bible every single day," she said. "Sundays then became about his bringing church and religion into our home. He would play gospel music—it had so much soul, and he loved that."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_14-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Family matriarch Kris Jenner only echoed that sentiment.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_16-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Even a family as crazy as ours can have a great relationship with God," Jenner <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>said</a> back in 2011.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_18-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Sounds like that Catholic-inspired Met Gala theme from a few weeks back was even more fitting for the Kar-Jenner crew than we thought.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK57zZ6urGebnrput8Crm5qrmJ6ur3nRnqOin5mku26z0aisqWWkmsW1</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestD - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
