Their romance began in late 2020 and ended at some point last year. During their time together, though, Future made many wholesome gestures for Dess and her family. Whether it was <a href=# rel>getting her a massive diamond ring for 2021 Valentine's Day</a> or <a href=# rel>getting Dior's mother a birthday present</a>, Future went above and beyond.</p><p>Additionally, the couple would be seen multiple times in public. Not afraid to flaunt their love for one another, Future and Dess Dior would post on social media about one another and go out together. While dating, <a href=# rel>the two went on a double date with Lil Uzi Vert and JT</a>, shared each other's music on their Instagram stories, fueled marriage rumors with formal outfits, and even rapped about each other. However, Pluto and Dess seemingly called it quits in 2022. Moving on from one another, the duo still seemed to be friendly though. This proved true when <a href=# rel>Future helped promote Dess' September 2022 EP on his Instagram story</a>.</p><span><h2 id=h-dess-dior-speaks-on-future>Dess Dior Speaks On Future</h2></span><p>Now, both thriving in their solo endeavors, Dess still has love for Future. In a recent interview with Angela Yee, Dess Dior was asked about her current standing with her ex. In a mature manner, Dior responded that she wishes for nothing but the best for him. "We're very very very good friends," she said. "He always supports me and I'll always support him. It's not bad blood. People get the wrong idea, it doesn't always have to end in a shit show. You know what I'm saying? Gracefully move on."</p><p>It's rare that we see celebrity couples break up and stay friendly with one another, but Dess assures it is because of how good of a person she is. Later in her response, Dess said there was no need for her to block Future's number or social media, and that there was no way he could "do her wrong" because there would be no reason to. While it isn't very likely Dior and Future would reunite, it is nice to see them be cordial and wholesome with each other.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvTp5ywoJmltbC8jZympmdmaIB4fJRmm56ro2KxqrvRZpuirqWhtKa%2FjKilZqqVoa61tc6nqqGhoGLEqsDHZp2urKWnsg%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestD - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
