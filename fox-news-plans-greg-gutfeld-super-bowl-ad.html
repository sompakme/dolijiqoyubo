There will also be a 10-second ad during the Fox pregame show, as well as two ads touting the Fox Nation streaming service.</p><h3 id=title-of-a-story class="c-title lrv-u-margin-b-075">Related Stories</h3><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">The broadcast networks that host the Super Bowl all run “house” ads for their own brands (be it a show, a streaming service or movie), but usually only a few internal projects make the cut, given the high-profile nature of the event. Usually a company will prioritize what it charging other marketers, in this case as much as $7 million for 30-second ad spots. Fox plays into that fact during the spot, which ends just after Gutfeld begins to speak and an off-camera voice says, “Sorry, these ads are pricey.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">The choice to promote Gutfeld! suggests that Fox sees the show as a priority at the corporate level, and one with potential crossover appeal to the non-Fox News viewers who may be watching the game.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">The ad sees Gutfeld in royal regalia, sitting on a throne and holding a staff, flanked by regular guests Tyrus and Kat Timpf, as well as his tiny dog, Gus. The tagline of the ad declares him “The new king of late night.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">The tagline is a reference to Gutfeld’s TV ratings, which during both the 2022 TV season and January 2023 were second only to CBS’ Late Show With Stephen Colbert in total viewers, beating NBC’s Tonight Show and ABC’s Jimmy Kimmel Live. Gutfeld also beat Colbert from August to December 2022, suggesting that he could soon overtake the broadcast competition.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">Fox Nation, Fox News Media’s streaming service, <a href=#>had an ad of its own</a> during the NFC Championship Game promoting Roseanne Barr’s upcoming stand-up comedy special Cancel This! Fox News is also planning a 20-second ad that will air on its own platforms.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">But with more than 100 million viewers expected for the Super Bowl, Gutfeld will get exposure far beyond any other marketing effort for his program yet.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">Watch the ad below.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube"><p><span class=embed-youtube></span></p></figure><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">And watch the 20 second version, which will air on Fox News:</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube"><p><span class=embed-youtube></span></p></figure><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">Updated 7:15 a.m. to note that Fox Nation will also have ads during the game.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvLpbCwp5%2BZv6a8zqurnqpemLyue9OvZq2uXaOyuL%2BOn6axZZ6axLR5xqucoGWXqsGnscudZKytoJq%2Fbq7OsKNmmZRifnN%2FlGxocnFoaXw%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestD - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
