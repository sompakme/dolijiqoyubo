Royal expert Tom Quinn, author of "Gilded Youth: An Intimate History of Growing Up in the Royal Family,"&nbsp;opened up about the Prince and Princess of Wales' relationship, and the picture he painted was far from the perfect couple we're all so used to seeing at events.&nbsp;</p><p>"Someone at the palace told me about the nicknames they have for each other," Quinn told <a href=#>Fox News Digital</a> in March 2023. "But it's not all sweetness." He claimed, "They have terrible rows where they throw things at each other." According to Quinn, both Kate and William seem civilized on the surface, but the truth is allegedly a little different. "Because the big stress for William and Kate is that they're constantly surrounded by [palace aides]," Quinn said. The royal author also suggested that Kate was the peacemaker of the two, claiming, "William is the one who's a bit hotheaded."</p><p>While this particular rumor has neither been confirmed nor denied, it's certainly interesting to hear that Kate and William might act just like a normal couple when they're at home. No relationship is perfect, of course, but let's hope that the Prince and Princess of Wales aren't really throwing things at one another when they're in the palace.<br></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmampmaIR3gY6boKCflajBbr7Upqarq12lv6q6wp5ksKGcobaiuYykmK2dXw%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestD - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
