Overall, she is someone who is known for her fashion sense. Additionally, she has even been called the "It girl" of the platform. Although not everyone is familiar with her, she is definitely making waves. In fact, she is reportedly dating <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">Miami Dolphins star Braxton Berrios</a>. This has led to plenty of fanfare around the NFL. While it may not get the same attention as Travis Kelce and <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Taylor Swift</a>, there are still those paying attention.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">As it turns out, Earle is not scared to get brutally honest about her life and the things she has experienced. On the Hot Mess podcast, Earle shared the time she thought she had contracted a sexually transmitted disease. Surprisingly, she thought she had gotten it from a mechanical bull. “This tailgate had a mechanical bull which is obviously so fun,” she began. “I’m flying around, I had my little game day outfit on … I rode that bull not once, not twice, probably 20 times thinking it was the coolest thing anyone’s ever seen.”</p><span><h2 class="__className_a6f35b font-bold text-2xl lg:text-[2.125rem] mb-[18px] font-poppins leading-10" id=h-alix-earle-and-the-false-alarm>Alix Earle And The False Alarm</h2></span><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Subsequently, when she got up the next day, there were bumps all over he legs. This put her in panic mode as she heard of a woman getting an STD from a similar activity. However, she had a roommate who was a nurse who was able to put her mind at ease. In the end, her prognosis was pretty simple. All she had was “bull burn from the tailgate.” It is a harrowing story, but one that will ingratiate her with fans who have wanted to get to know a little bit more about her and her backstory.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Only time will tell what she will branch out and do over the coming years.
