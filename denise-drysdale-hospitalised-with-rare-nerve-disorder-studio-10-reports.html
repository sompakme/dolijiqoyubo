Last week she was taken to hospital after suffering unspeakable agony that she described to me as a cross between being struck by a lightning bolt and a white hot poker.”</p><p>Bennett added: “It turns out she’s suffering from a rare nerve disorder that affects the face. Trigeminal neuralgia, it’s called.”</p><p>Bennett said he’d been speaking to Drysdale multiple times a day and that she was slowly on the mend.</p><p>“I know we all share in wishing our Denise Drysdale the speediest of recoveries. We need our regular dose of Ding Dong [Drysdale’s nickname].”</p><p>According to the Mayo Clinic, trigeminal neuralgia is a chronic pain condition affecting the trigeminal nerve in the face, which carries sensation from the face to the brain. It’s most common in women aged over 50.</p><p>Treatment includes medication, injections and surgery.</p><p>It comes after Drysdale was badly <a class=body-link href=# title=www.news.com.au data-tgev=event119 data-tgev-container=bodylink data-tgev-order=c7d76d83be961c01793eaeb7569e189b data-tgev-label=entertainment data-tgev-metric=ev>injured while filming the Channel 7 show </a><i><a class=body-link href=# title=www.news.com.au data-tgev=event119 data-tgev-container=bodylink data-tgev-order=c7d76d83be961c01793eaeb7569e189b data-tgev-label=entertainment data-tgev-metric=ev>Holey Moley</a></i> last year.</p><p>During filming in October, Drysdale tripped during a challenge and fell over, fracturing her shoulder. The episode went to air in February this year.</p><p>Drysdale sent a statement to news.com.au at the time, which said: “Mummy has took a tumble and has broken one of her chicken wings. The hospital are taking good care of me.”</p><h4 class=g_font-title-xxs>More Coverage</h4><p>Speaking on <i>Studio 10</i> this morning, Bennett said Drysdale had told him over the phone she “can’t take a trick”.</p><p>“She said, ‘Literally it’s one thing after the next. A tsunami of medical mishaps.’ I said, ‘Darling forget about a car, I’d just buy an ambulance,’” Bennett joked.</p><p>“You know what, she just keeps getting up and going,” co-host Sarah Harris added. “She’s got such a big heart and irrepressible energy.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7HWrGWcp51jrrZ7xKernqqklravucSnq2ispmS6sL7NoqWgZaOdvLi%2Fjp2cp6Gjmnqlvtism5qklWK1sL%2FPoquapJmosqV51qKroWWilr%2Bmec2eqa%2BdXZm2tLvRnZyrZ56axLR50q2mq7FfZYB0fZJqnWqcY2V%2FdHyUbJttbWVosKOumG6am25gl4Q%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestD - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
