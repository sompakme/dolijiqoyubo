He sold properties to Marvin Hamlisch, Kenny G, Frank Sinatra and Mark Burnett, and over the past decade he did luxury renovations for Marilyn and Jeffrey Katzenberg, Shelli and Irving Azoff, Deborah and Allen Grubman and Jimmy Iovine, among others.</p><h3 id=title-of-a-story class="c-title lrv-u-margin-b-075">Related Stories</h3><p>“The full scope of what Gallin does for his clients is ineffable. Interior design doesn’t quite cover it,” Architectural Digest <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">wrote</a> in a March 2014 feature story. “He is part executive producer, part set designer, part decorator, part picker, part psychologist.</p><p>“All of his projects share a key quality. As Calvin Klein explains, ‘Often what even great interior designers do is create a space that isn’t as comfortable and warm as what Sandy does, and that is the essence of why people like his work.'”</p><p>As The Hollywood Reporter <a href=# rel=noopener>noted</a> in October 2015: “But despite the proliferation of show business people, [Gallin’s] interiors are far from showy: Think natural materials, earth tones and obsessively curated art, lighting and textiles.”</p><p>Gallin also was renowned for throwing lavish parties and dinners, from Malibu to the Hamptons.</p><p>Albert Samuel Gallin was born in Brooklyn and raised in the wealthy village of Lawrence on Long Island. His father was a home builder and his mother a housewife. When he was 15, his dad filed for bankruptcy, and the family had to sell their home to cover their debts.</p><p>Growing up, Gallin was certain that he wanted to work in show business, he told the Times.</p><p>“It was the day of the pretty boy — Ricky Nelson, Frankie Avalon, Fabian — and I thought, ‘I don’t look like them. I am not going to make it, because I am not gorgeous,'” he said. “So I decided I would go behind the camera. [Even then] I knew I wanted to be a manager and a producer.”</p><p>Gallin graduated from Boston University with a degree in public relations and communications, then landed a job in the mailroom at General Artists Corp., a talent agency.</p><p>Within three years, he had been promoted to agent and was representing the likes of Nelson, Avalon, Paul Anka, Phyllis Diller, Steve Lawrence & Eydie Gorme, Dr. Joyce Brothers, Laura Nero and Joni Mitchell.</p><p>Around this time, he signed Pryor, then an unknown comic, and repped Rivers, Tiny Tim and Cass Elliot, whom he teamed with John Phillips, Denny Doherty and Michelle Phillips to create the folk rock supergroup The Mamas & the Papas.</p><p>Gallin was great at getting his acts on The Ed Sullivan Show and on other variety shows, and soon he turned to producing those shows and TV specials himself.</p><h3 id=title-of-a-story class="c-title lrv-u-margin-b-075">Related Stories</h3><p>He moved to the West Coast and in 1970 partnered with his cousin, Raymond Katz, for their own management firm. To his everlasting regret, he spurned an offer to start a company with David Geffen, who would become one of his best friends.</p><p>After an acrimonious split with Katz, he launched his own management firm as well as Sandollar —&nbsp;its moniker is based on his and Parton’s first names — in 1985. He also produced the Parton-starring movies Rhinestone (1984) and Straight Talk (1992).</p><p>In 1998, Gallin turned his sights on Las Vegas and created Mirage Entertainment & Sports with Steve Wynn. For Broadway, he produced Monday After the Miracle in 1982 and revivals of Hedda Gabler in 2001 and Man of La Mancha in 2002.</p><p>When Katzenberg approached him to redesign his 10,000-square-foot California ranch-style house in Beverly&nbsp;Hills, Gallin had a new career.</p><p>“People asked me for years about redoing their homes, but I always said no,” Gallin <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">told</a> The Wall Street Journal in 2013. “Then the market became more tenuous, and Jeffrey asked me to do his house, and I thought it might be fun. In some ways, doing a house for another person is very similar to managing a star — they tell me what they want, and I try to figure out how to make their dream a reality.”</p><h3 id=title-of-a-story class="c-title lrv-u-margin-b-075">Related Stories</h3><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvLpbCwp5%2BZv6a8zqurnqpemLyue82erqxnl5q7pr7ApWSnnaeofLStzZ2wZp%2BRobmquoydnJqcXamurbHNrWSmmZ6WtKa%2BjKmpqJylmLKzeceopJ5llJrAqrPNnqlmr5GoeniCjHJwbG9hanw%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestD - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
