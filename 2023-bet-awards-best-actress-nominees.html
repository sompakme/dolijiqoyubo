On the 25th of June, the ceremony will be held in Los Angeles, California at the Microsoft Theater. Although a host is yet to be announced, one should be revealed within the next couple of days. However, one major category that’s garnered attention is that of the Best Actress.&nbsp;</p><p>At the previous year’s ceremony, the number of nominees increased from six to nine, but the number has been brought down to seven in 2023. Currently holding the title is Zendaya, who won for her roles in HBO’s Euphoria and Spider-Man: No Way Home. First-time nominees include Abbot Elementary’s standout star Janelle James, as well as Keke Palmer for her star-elevating turn in the Western horror movie, Nope.&nbsp;</p><p>The competition is as tight as ever. Regardless, here are all the seven nominees up for Best Actress at the 2023 BET Awards.&nbsp;</p><span><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-angela-bassett>Angela Bassett</h2></span><p>Angela Bassett has already made history as the first MCU actor to earn an acting award at major awards ceremonies. So it’s no surprise that she’s once again earned another nod at the upcoming BET Awards. Bassett’s nomination for Best Actress officially makes her the most nominated woman in the history of the category. She has been up for the trophy eleven times in the past, and this year marks her twelfth time.&nbsp;</p><p>Unfortunately, she’s yet to snag the award, but her recent win streak might spell a different tale this year. In addition to her work as Queen Ramonda in <a href=# rel>Black Panther: Wakanda Forever</a>, Basset’s nod also recognizes her work in television. Her leading role as Sergeant Athena Grant-Nash on the procedural drama 9-1-1 has been continuously commended.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Read More:</strong> <a href=# rel>2023 BET Awards: Best Female Hip Hop Artist Nominees Breakdown</a></p><span><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Coco Jones</h2></span><p>Last year, Coco Jones earned her first Best Actress nod at the BET Awards. This was thanks to her fabulous reimagination of Hilary Banks in Bel-Air. Jones has received widespread acclaim for her portrayal of the character. She has served to introduce the character to a new generation of viewers while maintaining the spunk of the original. Besides the Best Actress nod, Jones is also up for the 2023 BET Awards for Best New Artist and Best Female R&B/Pop Artist, due to <a href=# rel>her stellar year as a musician</a>.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Read More:</strong> <a href=# rel>2023 BET Awards: Best Male Hip Hop Artist Nominees</a></p><span><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Janelle James</h2></span><p>Janelle James has been making people laugh for decades, but her breakthrough role on <a href=# rel>Abbott Elementary</a> has been truly exceptional. James stars as Principal Ava in the comedy mockumentary, and her hilarious role has been constantly praised by fans and critics alike. 2023 marks James’ first Best Actress nomination at the BET Awards.

She won in 2012 for her roles in Extremely Loud & Incredibly Close, as well as The Help. Davis is one of the most awarded actresses of her generation.
