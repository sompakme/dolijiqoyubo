First of all, the great and powerful <span data-scayt_word=Khal data-scaytid=2>Khal</span> died at the end of season one, and actor <strong>Jason <span data-scayt_word=Momoa data-scaytid=4>Momoa</span></strong>, who played him, resides in Los Angeles. But he flew into New York at the beginning of fashion week to join his best L.A. buddy and favorite <span data-scayt_word=SoCal data-scaytid=5>SoCal</span> clothing designer (of the label <span data-scayt_word=MadeWorn data-scaytid=6>MadeWorn</span>) <strong>Blaine Halvorson</strong> for an IMG-sponsored panel called “Walk, Don’t Run,” a discussion on artisanal handcrafting in the age of&nbsp; technology and fast-moving everything.</p><p><strong>See More </strong><a href=# rel=noopener>New York Fashion Week’s Front Row</a></p><p>Turns out <span data-scayt_word=Momoa data-scaytid=7>Momoa</span> and Halvorson have a passion in common: Both spend a lot of time making things with their hands. Halvorson, of course, designs and creates handcrafted clothes, shoes and bags for men and women — and many a celebrity — but is also a well-known visual artist. In fact, he created a major installation for <span data-scayt_word=NYFW data-scaytid=9>NYFW</span> at IMG’s HQ on West <span data-scayt_word=14th data-scaytid=10>14th</span> Street (also called “Walk, Don’t Run”) which featured, among many nostalgic and manmade elements, five thousand pairs of beat up boots piled high around a work table, where the artist/designer himself worked on pairs of his custom-made boots for the entirety of fashion week.</p><p>We caught up with the two men at a party after their panel, and chatted with the duo right in the middle of the installation.</p><p><strong><span data-scayt_word=Pret-a-Reporter data-scaytid=11>Pret-a-Reporter</span></strong>: Jason, how did you meet Blaine?</p><p><strong>Jason <span data-scayt_word=Momoa data-scaytid=12>Momoa</span>: </strong>My wife [<strong>Lisa <span data-scayt_word=Bonet data-scaytid=15>Bonet</span>]</strong>&nbsp;sent me over to <span data-scayt_word=MadeWorn data-scaytid=13>MadeWorn</span> last year because she loves his clothes and shoes so much. Blaine and I also have a mutual friend in <strong>Brett Easton Ellis</strong>. Turns out, Blaine and I have similar taste — that’s why I’m wearing his shirt, vest and pants right now! He came up to my house and we discovered we both share a love of handcrafting and working with our hands.</p><p><strong>Blaine Halvorson: </strong>We’re wearing almost the same thing right now, if you notice. Different coloration and fades.</p><p><span data-scayt_word=JM data-scaytid=18>JM</span>: I had bought some <span data-scayt_word=MadeWorn data-scaytid=17>MadeWorn</span> clothes at <span data-scayt_word=Maxfield’s data-scaytid=20>Maxfield’s</span> awhile back, and then when I couldn’t find them anymore, the staff told me Blaine was creating his own space for the brand. His attention to detail is amazing. I’ve never seen anyone put his own stamp on everything he does like that — his art, clothes, bags, boots, rock t-shirts — even the rooms of his gallery and shop. Not only that — I’m 6’5” and 220 pounds — nothing fits me!</p><p><span data-scayt_word=BH data-scaytid=21>BH</span>: I custom make things for Jason’s height and shape. That’s the only way clothes wind up fitting well.</p><p><span data-scayt_word=JM data-scaytid=22>JM</span>: Blaine, how long did it take you to put up this massive installation?</p><p><span data-scayt_word=BH data-scaytid=23>BH</span>: I planned it back in Los Angeles for months and I knew the dimensions of the room. But you don’t know what it will look like or how it would fit till you get into the actual space. I got in two nights before set-up and then the truck with all the pieces here was reported stolen. Somehow it showed up at the end of the next day. So I did a major <span data-scayt_word=all-nighter data-scaytid=26>all-nighter</span> setting it up. And I wound up using every single piece I hauled across the country.</p><p><strong>Read More </strong><a href=# rel=noopener>NYFW Beauty: This is Why Model’s Skin Looks So Freaking Great</a></p><p><strong>Where did you procure all these boots that look like the ones that take you many days to create?</strong></p><p>BH: Someone called me to call this dude downtown. He had a couple thousand. I said, I need much more. So he found me five thousand pairs. Of course, they had to be black.</p><p><strong>How did the panel go?</strong></p><p>JM: I was honored to be a part of it. Blaine and I have been talking for a long time about a return of making things by hand in your own time. A few like minded crafts people working together. Everything right now is like Walmart — giant, outsized. We’re at such a loss for community and attention to detail.</p><p>BH: The “slow movement” translates to everything. Prior to World War II, America was the best at everything — building cars, making watches. Now everything is machine made.</p><p><strong>The installation even smells great.</strong></p><p>BH: That’s because we’re burning my incense that I make [and sell] — it’s called Smoke.</p><p>JM: It smells like Blaine!</p><p><a href=#><img decoding=async alt src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.hollywoodreporter.com//sites/default/files/custom/Inline%20Graphics%20(Product%20Only)/2015/style/Spring2016Promo.jpg width=100% style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><h3 id=title-of-a-story class="c-title lrv-u-margin-b-075">Related Stories</h3><h3 id=title-of-a-story class="c-title lrv-u-margin-b-075">Related Stories</h3><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvLpbCwp5%2BZv6a8zqurnqpemLyue82erqxnl5q7pr7ApWSnnaeofKitzJ5kraCipLumv4yjmKynnmK6sLnOmmSao5FihXN%2FlXJtaA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestD - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
