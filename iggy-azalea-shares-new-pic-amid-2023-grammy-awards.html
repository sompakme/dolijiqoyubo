Azalea is set to release the untitled project in the summer of 2023. Subscriptions to Azalea’s OnlyFans (onlyfans.com/iggyazalea) cost $25 per month.</p><p>LAS VEGAS, NV - SEPTEMBER 20: Rapper Iggy Azalea performs onstage during the 2014 iHeartRadio Music Festival Village on September 20, 2014 in Las Vegas, Nevada.

She's since admitted that she had a skewed perspective of the website and has changed her mind. Azalea says OnlyFans allows her to avoid the “overwhelming and creatively limiting censorship” of other digital platforms.</p><p>“Admittedly, I never knew OnlyFans was a place where I could be creative, so I didn’t expect to be collaborating with them on my biggest project to date!” Azalea said in a statement provided to Variety. “Once I looked beyond the surface-level chatter about what it means to have an OnlyFans, I realized it was the perfect platform to launch a multimedia concept on. I feel excited about not having to worry about the overwhelming and creatively limiting censorship artists have to navigate when sharing work on other digital platforms. The project is bold and fun — so is this collaboration — I think it’s going to surprise a lot of people.”</p><p>While she wasn't at the Grammy Awards, she's received four nominations throughout her career. At the 57th Annual Grammy Awards, she was up for Best New Artist, Record of the Year, and Best Pop Duo/Group Performance for "Fancy" and Best Rap Album for The New Classic. The Recording Academy has yet to nominate her again in the years since. But perhaps <a href=# rel>Hotter Than Hell</a> will change that.
