Maxwell allegedly suggested she talk to Epstein about it.</p><p>"What I understood was that Maria had a very wealthy boss and that he might want to help me with school," Annie Farmer told 20/20 last year.

But because it was her, I was more open to that," she said. "They were really, really good at figuring out how to push boundaries so that I didn't say, 'No I'm not going to do this.'
