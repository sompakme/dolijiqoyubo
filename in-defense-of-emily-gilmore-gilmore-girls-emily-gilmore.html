I fancied myself a Rory Gilmore before Rory Gilmore was even a thing (though I'll admit I had my fair share of April Nardini moments—sadly minus the enviable science fair prowess).</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/QvWF2bPaByDNGMoYaMq4cc-1920-80.gif><p>I was bookish and nerdy, and while I wasn't shy, I was definitely introverted. I had a great relationship with my mom. I liked junk food way more than, uh, non-junk food. I dreamed of leaving my hometown for the Ivy Leagues. And as a middle schooler, all of the above was more than enough reason for me to feel like I was looking in a mirror when I saw Rory onscreen.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Th6dy6k3YaRoXQK2ouaSyk-1920-80.gif><p>But confession: I stopped watching&nbsp;Gilmore Girls&nbsp;during season five. I&nbsp;could&nbsp;claim that I stopped out of protest for Rory's relationship with now-married Dean, but that would be a lie. At the time I supported her 100%, and thought it was&nbsp;great&nbsp;that their love found a way. I wasn't just drinking the Rory Gilmore Kool-Aid—I was chugging it like cops were about to break up the party.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/idzy5NTiY9E7GKymyRngaE-1920-80.gif><p>In reality, I stopped watching&nbsp;Gilmore Girls&nbsp;for boring "life" reasons; I was 16, suddenly had a part-time job, and had a lot more school commitments (those Ivy League applications were fast approaching). My family didn't have TiVo (remember when DVRs were all TiVos?), so I eventually got a few episodes behind, which turned into lot of episodes behind. There was no way to catch up.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/oRLgXHYCXHvmjK4Pkho4MP-1920-80.gif><p>Still, even though I wasn't watching the show, Rory Gilmore was still in my heart. I had only seen her freshman year of college play out, but I was sure she was doing great (HA!), and still listed her among my fictional idols. When I left for college, I cut my hair into a bob because&nbsp;that's what Rory did her freshman year. It felt symbolic and important, and made me feel close to her—as if by getting her haircut, I was also channeling her academic essence.</p><p>Confession No. 2: When&nbsp;Gilmore Girls&nbsp;came to Netflix, it took an embarrassingly long time for me to finish the series. But when I did finally watch in anticipation of&nbsp;Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life,&nbsp;I didn't just finish it. I binged it. And by the end of the show, Rory was no longer my favorite Gilmore Girl. Neither was Lorelai. No, in 2016, my favorite Gilmore Girl was—no,&nbsp;is—Emily Gilmore. (It's sort of like the time I realized that after years self-identifying as a Ravenclaw, the Sorting Hat would definitely whisper, "...But you could do&nbsp;great&nbsp;things in Slytherin" upon being placed on my head).</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/694jnxuiDdBthAKFdMnjDY-1920-80.gif><p>As a teenager, I identified so strongly with Rory that when we weren't on the same page, I adjusted to be more like her. As an adult, the Gilmore lady I aspire to emulate is Emily, 100%. Here's why she's a boss:</p><p class=newsletter-form__strapline>Marie Claire email subscribers get intel on fashion and beauty trends, hot-off-the-press celebrity news, and more.

Not to wait around for things to happen, but to&nbsp;make&nbsp;them happen. The older I get, the more and more I do just that.</p><h2 id=she-isn-apos-t-afraid-to-ask-for-okay-demand-what-she-wants-out-of-life-3>She isn't afraid to ask for (okay, demand) what she wants out of life.</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/im6yjyFs6HiZnbc54wpm7-1920-80.gif><p>Emily knows what she wants and that, I think, is half the battle. The younger Gilmores are often crippled by indecision, but Emily is incredibly decisive. That's admirable.</p><h2 id=she-plays-the-game-but-she-knows-when-to-break-the-rules-and-stand-up-for-her-and-hers-3>She plays the game, but she knows when to break the rules and stand up for her and hers.</h2><p>Remember that time Emily straight up dismantled Shira Huntzberger for saying Rory wasn't good enough for Logan?

Emily tries to be flexible, and connect with Lorelai and Rory. She doesn't always succeed, but when she does, it's beautiful and there's pudding for all.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/c2j7KvshhYqXBCr6JnqEyQ-1920-80.gif><h2 id=she-apos-s-a-twinkie-3>She's a Twinkie.</h2><p>To paraphrase the great philosopher&nbsp;<a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pGf4ObRAfRQ" referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-hl-processed=none>Wallace Fennel</a>, underneath that angry grown woman shell, there's a slightly less angry grown woman who's just dying to connect with her daughter and granddaughter.
