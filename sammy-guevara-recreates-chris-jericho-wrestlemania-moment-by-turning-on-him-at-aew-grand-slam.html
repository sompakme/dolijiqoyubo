Sammy Guevara might have paid tribute to Chris Jericho during their match together, but things did not end on a respectful note at all.</p><p><a href=#>We previously reported on handful of AEW Rampage spoilers.</a></p><p>Sammy Guevara paid homage to Chris Jericho’s WrestleMania gear when he faced Shawn Michaels so many years ago. That Mania match saw another tribute at the end of the entire contest as well.</p><p>Guevara and Jericho battled in Arthur Ashe Stadium, and they had quite a battle. In the end, Jericho won the match by hitting a Codebreaker as Guevara was coming off the top rope.</p><p>Sammy Guevara lost clean after that, but he wasn’t finished. He also wasn’t finished with his tribute to Chris Jericho. After all, following Jericho and HBK’s Mania match, YJ2 nailed Shawn Michaels with a low-blow kick to the groin. That is exactly what The Spanish God did to The Wizard.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"></figure><p>After that move, Don Callis walked out smiling. It appears that Sammy Guevara is now a part of Don Callis’ stable. This was quite an interesting move, especially how Callis broke up the Jericho Appreciation Society, just because he was talking to Jericho.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"></figure><p>We will keep an eye on this story, and so much more, right here at <a href=#>Ringside News</a>.
