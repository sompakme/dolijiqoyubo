The actor's father, Stuart Pearce, was tragically killed in a plane crash when Guy was just eight years old, so he was primarily raised by his mum.&nbsp;</p><p id=eSnnCxdpEwQ data-wc=44>Speaking to <a class=hm-link href=# rel=nofollow>The Times</a> in November 2022, Guy also explained that he helped his mum raise his older sister, Tracy, who was diagnosed with Cornelia de Lange syndrome – a rare genetic disorder present from birth which results in physical, cognitive, and medical challenges.&nbsp;</p><p id=eUfT1CCmUmZ data-wc=58>"A big part of why I never wanted to have children was because I helped raise my sister – I have a sister with an intellectual disability – so I felt like I'd done my parenting," he said last year. "For a long time, I definitely knew I was never going to have kids. It was quite definite."</p><p id=eCzeFFjBqfw data-wc=32>While Guy went on to welcome his son Monte with <a class=hm-link href=#>Game of Thrones&nbsp;actress Carice van Houten</a> in 2016, his role as a father has still come as a surprise.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/557a4a291052-guy-pearce-carice.jpg><p id=eUHQX-mADcN data-wc=95>"I am just besotted with my child. I mean, it's ridiculous, although it took a while for me to actually believe that my child was really my child," he told the publication. "It's a sort of slow turning around of the ship. Even though my body was kind of going, 'You're my child and I just want to hold you close,' my brain was going, 'No, you don't have a child.' I was like, 'Yeah, but I do'. My brain is going, 'No, you decided years ago you were never going to have a child.'"</p><p id=e7LlSGcyUv data-wc=11><strong>MORE:&nbsp;</strong><a class=hm-link href=#>Kate Hudson mourns tragic passing with emotional tribute: 'So sad'</a></p><p id=eRWXtVIpHB data-wc=14><strong>READ:&nbsp;</strong><a class=hm-link href=#>Elton John flooded with condolences after sudden death of 'one of the greats'</a></p><p id=encxeQkVDSy data-wc=72>Reflecting on his own childhood, Guy has also credited Anne – who worked as a teacher – with helping to inspire his love of acting. In 2009, he told <a class=hm-link href=# rel=nofollow>Mail Online</a>: "I loved going to the theatre with my mum. I was completely awestruck that the actors could have such an effect on the audience and make them think that they were smart and funny.
