According to sources, their interaction was strictly professional and amicable. They both attended the opening of their restaurant chain's new location as co-owners, fulfilling their contractual obligations. It is clarified that Ne-Yo and Crystal are currently dating other people while successfully co-parenting their three children.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Crystal divorced Ne-Yo last year following his involvement with another woman, which resulted in the birth of a child. The singer has a predetermined number of appearances to make for their shared restaurant chain, Johnny's Chicken and Waffles. Crystal, on the other hand, actively participates in the day-to-day operations. This explains their joint presence at the grand opening in midtown Atlanta. Although they will continue to encounter each other due to their business plans of opening three more locations, their interactions do not signify a romantic reunion.</p><span><h2 class="__className_a6f35b font-bold text-2xl lg:text-[2.125rem] mb-[18px] font-poppins leading-10" id=h-ne-yo-calls-himself-toxic>Ne-Yo Calls Himself Toxic</h2></span><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">During a recent interview on Shannon Sharpe's Club Shay Shay podcast, Ne-Yo discussed the possibility of dating <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Taylor Swift</a>. Sharpe commented that they would make a cute couple. However, Ne-Yo expressed his belief that Taylor Swift <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">wouldn't be interested in him due to his "toxic" behavior</a>. He jokingly stated that he would mess things up for her and conveyed his respect for her. However, Ne-Yo's remarks received a mixed reaction from fans in the comments section of Sharpe's post.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Some fans criticized Ne-Yo for referring to himself as toxic and urged him to grow up. Others interpreted his statement as acknowledging that Taylor Swift has her own success and independence. As such, it would make her less susceptible to manipulation. Following his divorce from Crystal Renay in February, Ne-Yo expressed his openness to dating fans of his music. He mentioned that he prefers connecting with "regular people." He believes they can understand his experiences as a celebrity while also being relatable. What do you think of Ne-Yo and his ex-wife working together?
