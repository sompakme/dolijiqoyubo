A separate image depicts a recreation of Harry and Will on their 1997 vacation to Balmoral Castle with their father Charles.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_5-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Netflix</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_8-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The first six-episode installment will also follow Princess Diana's relationship with Dodi Al Fayed (played by Khalid Abdalla) and will pick up on the Al Fayed family yacht trip to Saint Tropez that we saw Diana packing for at the end of the fifth season.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_10-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Netflix</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_11-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“We’re very much in the beginning of the Princess Diana and Dodi Fayed story,” executive producer Suzanne Mackie told TUDUM. “From the second she steps onto that boat and [you begin to see] some of those iconic images of her on the yacht, it does take you immediately to the whirlwind that was the press speculation around that romance."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_13-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Part one will also <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>"delicately" depict</a> the untimely death of Princess Diana.
