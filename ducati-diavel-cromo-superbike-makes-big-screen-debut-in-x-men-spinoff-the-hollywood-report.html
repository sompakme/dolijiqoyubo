One of the main stars of the film, besides <strong>Hugh </strong><strong>Jackman</strong>‘s&nbsp;arms, is the Ducati Diavel Cromo. The Diavel, first introduced in 2012, is a departure from traditional Ducati superbikes with its low-slung stance and enhanced upright riding position and is prominently featured in the new film.</p><p>This marks the first time Ducati is working with their new corporate owner, Audi, which has their R8 V10 Spyder and A8L featured alongside the Ducati Diavel Cromo in the film. Audi brought the Ducati brand under its German wings in mid-2012 when it acquired the famed Italian brand for about $1.12 billion.</p><p><a href=# rel=noopener><strong>PHOTOS: 26 of Summer’s Most Anticipated Movies: ‘Man of Steel,’ ‘Wolverine,’ ‘The Lone Ranger’</strong></a></p><p>Ducati&nbsp;had been an aspirational gleam in the eyes of motorcyclists worldwide but never sold as well as it should have due to a series of undercapitalized owners, of which there have been many since 1985. First, fellow Italian motorcycle company&nbsp;Cagiva, followed by the Texas Pacific Group, then Investindustrial SpA in 2005 and Performance Motorcycles SpA in 2008, and so on.&nbsp;Ducati always made lustful superbikes like the 848 EVO Corse, the Monster 796 and the top of the range, 1199 Panigale R, a bike with such wicked performance one would think it’s possessed by the God of Speed. But Ducati never reached the status or sales needed to propel it into major profitability. Now, under Audi and the deep-pocketed VW Group, Ducati is reaching their potential. The&nbsp;Wolverine marks the first time the two brands have been featured in a cross-promo package together and has the makings of a match made in petrol heaven.</p><p>Ducati is also featured in Universal’s Kick Ass 2, set to launch August 16. In the film, Ducati’s flagship superbike, the 1199 Panigale, was painted purple to match the costume of <strong>Chloe Grace </strong><strong>Moretz</strong>’s Hit Girl character and features some prominent screen time. Earlier this summer,&nbsp;Fast & Furious 6 featured the Ducati Monster 1100 Evo.</p><p><a href=# rel=noopener><strong>STORY: 5 Ways to Fix the Summer Movie Box-Office Crisis&nbsp;</strong></a></p><p>“What excited us about partnering with the filmmakers on this one was the story, tone and setting in Japan,” says <strong>Arden&nbsp;Doss</strong>, CEO of Iconic Entertainment, which handles Audi’s product placement. “Director <strong>James Mangold </strong>created a fresh, modern and dynamic canvas that showcases our supercar and the evolution of The Wolverine. Audi has a strong relationship with <a href=# id=auto-tag_hugh-jackman data-tag=hugh-jackman>Hugh Jackman</a>, and we also saw the unique opportunity to help promote the film by uniting forces with Ducati when we made that teaser video.”</p><p>The Diavel Cromo is an alternative to the standard Diavel and features chrome-finished tank panels with a vintage “Meccanica”-style Ducati logo, a look that is repeated on the single seat cover and underlined with vintage-style, horizontally ribbed seat upholstery. The exhaust end-caps and handlebars are finished in black, and the Diavel Chromo’s overall gloss black finish is enhanced with a silver pinstripe on the front fender, a single-seat cover, tank center and headlamp body. The word “Cromo” is laser-engraved into the air-duct panels on either side of the fuel tank for a pretty swell custom look. That said, the Wolverine’s Diavel Chromo, according to deeply placed sources within the brand, features no parts milled from adamantium, so, when you plunk down your $18,995 at the Ducati dealer, don’t bother asking.</p><p>Said <strong>Dominique Cheraki</strong>, general manager of Ducati North America about the Diavel in the film, “We believe the Diavel was selected for The Wolverine because it embodies a sense of power and&nbsp;has a commanding presence that adds to the strength of the&nbsp;character.”</p><p><img decoding=async alt src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.hollywoodreporter.com/sites/default/files/custom/Blog_Images/Wolverine_Ducati_a_p.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><h3 id=title-of-a-story class="c-title lrv-u-margin-b-075">Related Stories</h3><h3 id=title-of-a-story class="c-title lrv-u-margin-b-075">Related Stories</h3><h3 id=title-of-a-story class="c-title lrv-u-margin-b-075">Related Stories</h3><h3 id=title-of-a-story class="c-title lrv-u-margin-b-075">Related Stories</h3><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvLpbCwp5%2BZv6a8zqurnqpemLyue8uinZ6rpK65pnvLop2eq6SuuaZ5zZ6urGenpLm3sdGipZ5llKqwosDIZpuimaaauW6v0aikqGWjqr2mvsGiop5lZW6Bcn2SaA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestD - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
